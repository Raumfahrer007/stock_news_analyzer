The stock tanked with everything else in April during liberation day and I was down to $526. I had to deposit another $10,000 to pick myself up and take revenge on the market. 

Luckily I caught Google on the dip to 148 and I had conviction that Google was going to the moon based on its P/E and great ai plays. 

I kept buying 5% otm calls 30 days out on red days and selling when the calls were in the money. Then I would open another position with more and more contracts every time. 

The last push was this weekend before Labor Day I held $450,000 cash and unloaded it on the dip Monday at 207 and bought $4.70 950 contracts of 220 strike calls for 10/17. Those calls were up $91,000 end of the day as you can see from my previous post. Today I sold at $16 per contract. ",24918
1ly582b,2025-07-12 18:55:03,Reddit,wallstreetbets,"NVDA, GOOGL",$1.4m --> $5.4m in 18 Months - 85% in Cash Now,"I've lost a lot of sleep over the past 18 months trading my mom's IRA (she's more than ok with this!), and I've been able to substantially outperform the market.  I lost most of her portfolio 3 months ago in April (bottom tick was $800k) but have been able to grow it back to a much higher value than it was before the tariff BS.

Total gains in 18 months: $4,000,000

I have been trading options (obviously, this is WSB.) For the first 6 months, my big winner was HIMS, although I sold WAY too early. I bought calls around $10 and sold around $20-$24. My other big plays have been scalping NVDA and especially GOOGL. Despite being a lousy hold for the last year, I've consistently YOLO'd into GOOGL on big pull backs, including the Apple congressional testimony news (Google searches were down for the first time on Safari, although Google denied this.)

My strategy is to buy near or at-the-money calls 2-5 months out with at least one earnings in between. I don't usually hold through earnings. I try to scale out of the position over the course of 2-10 trading days. I'm happy with 20%-50% gains and am fine with leaving money on the table. Because the calls are many months out, there isn't too much theta decay if the stock goes sideways.

I generally keep cash on the side to YOLO into calls if there's a huge overreaction on a given ticker. If I'm fully invested, it's hard to take advantage of certain opportunities. I don't think I have that much patience, but I've definitely improved since my early trading days.

On Friday I sold most of the portfolio and am now 85%  in cash. The other 15% is in QQQ puts and UNH calls. I think there will be buying opportunities soon given the new EU / Canada tariff news, but ultimately, as we all know, taco's gonna taco.",17771

1gm4gzv,2024-11-08 00:31:01,Reddit,wallstreetbets,NVDA,YOLO $35k into 1.1MM to save the family farm. ,"Fellow regards, longtime lurker breaking the silence to YOLO $32K to save the family farm.

Grandaddy died in April this year leaving a 3 generation farm, (fully paid, no debt) to my parents. Mom never worked and my dad’s income has never been much (minister at small church). Unsurprisingly, mom and dad want to cash in on that sweet sweet inheritance $$$ by selling the farm and upgrading their lifestyle with the proceeds.

I would give my right kidney to keep that farm if I knew how to sell it. It’s where I grew up, convinced my girlfriend (now wife) to marry me, and want our two small children to make their own memories there. 

I’ve traded positions in $NVDA, $ASTS, $RKLB and $RDDT (thanks to this community) hoping to somehow make enough to buy the farm but have only managed roughly to double my money ($15K to $32K). I completely realize it’s an idiot move but it’s the only chance I have at this point and I’m 100% willing to go to $0 if there is a chance I can make it to $1.1MM. 

The farm is going to be listed next week and I want to go full regard with my portfolio to buy it. If I sell my house I still need $1.1MM to make up the difference and I’m willing to bet everything I have in the market for the chance to make it happen. 

Would happily go all-in on anything that might print before February since the farm will probably be sold around that time. 

Before anyone asks, there is no other way. My folks want the $$$ now and won’t sell the farm for any less than market value to me or anyone else. Renting the tillable acres to a local farmer would only cover 1.5 months of the mortgage payment. Maybe the best offer is $800K, maybe the real estate market crashes tomorrow, but bottom line is I have to close the gap between $35K and $1.1MM to have any shot at keeping it. 

TLDR: regard wants to yolo his 100% gains on a moonshot to save his sentimentality important childhood home knowing full well he should blow it on strippers stead because it would be more fun.

1jwdal8,2025-04-11 02:36:46,Reddit,wallstreetbets,NVDA,I all-in'd and held 400k in UVIX for 6 months. I finally sold.,"First off, I would like to preface this with saying my condolences to those who have incurred any losses lately. It has been a very volatile week, and I know many friends and family who have suffered heavy losses in their portfolio and are stressed/anxious for the future to come. With that, I would like to share my experience betting against the American economy by holding one of the most volatile stock for 6 months, UVIX.

As many of you may know, VIX is an index that grows rapidly when the market reverses from a peak. I personally witnessed this during Covid (when TVIX rose almost 2000%) and the recent ""Yen Carry Trade"" of August 5th (when UVIX rose 400%). I've always aspired to time the market successfully with UVIX.

Last year, I felt that the economy was overextended for many reasons. You guys may not agree that these are factors to what led us here, but these are why I ended up taking the biggest risk of my life with such high confidence that the market would crash short-term.

\- US National Debt: We've reached a staggering $36 trillion debt, a large increase of 8 trillion post-covid. To me, this was a huge red flag indicating a looming recession, especially since the market was still pumping.

\- AI Bubble: I think AI is heavily over-hyped, and the rise of NVDA/Tech stocks were not really warranted. I saw this as a bubble bound to pop, much like the dot-com and housing bubble of 2008.

\- Terrible job market: I think we've been experiencing a bad labor market across all sectors for a while now. Employers look to make lay-offs/cost cutting in order to artificially inflate profit margins to boost stock prices, which is not sustainable. I do not believe the numbers released by the Feds at all, they seem suspiciously low compared to real-world experiences of people struggling to find work. This article was one example:  
[https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-added-818000-fewer-jobs-thought-adding-concerns-economy-rcna167555](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-added-818000-fewer-jobs-thought-adding-concerns-economy-rcna167555)

\- Suicide rate is apparently one of the leading indicator of a struggling economy: In 2024, we reached one of the highest rate in the decade [https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-09-26/u-s-suicide-rate-climbs-back-to-highest-in-decades](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-09-26/u-s-suicide-rate-climbs-back-to-highest-in-decades)

\- Trump winning the presidential election: I was aware of his tariff plans during his campaign, and I knew that if he actually did implement these, it would shock the market. It was only a question of if he would actually deliver on his campaign promise or not, which he did.

With all these reasonings in mind, I had a 90% confidence that the market would crash soon, so I YOLO'd my whole portfolio into UVIX after election.

https://preview.redd.it/ovma6m9vj3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd719e0b6d0ff7892d07461aa3eae2312d52caea

Holding this ticker was mentally tough, the market kept rallying from 580 to 620 post-election, and my position was decaying and I was holding a -200k loss for the vast majority of the time. Many people discouraged my position, and some think I should cut my losses. I even isolated myself for a while because I was so sure of my bet. There were two moments when I could have sold to break even: Federal reserve announcing no future interest rate cuts and Trump's initial Canada/Mexico tariffs. But UVIX didn't rise as much as I anticipated, so I kept holding.

https://preview.redd.it/e5e6xfsxj3ue1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f45917088fa769ca5123420f1fec427851fbb2f

Fast forward to last week, Trump announced a severe blanket tariff, which crashed the market as we know it. This was finally the moment I've been waiting for as UVIX went from $20 to $100 in the span of 4 days. I kept my eyes on the news, set my alarm to 6 am to watch the market open. UVIX could rapidly drop/rise in matter of seconds, and I did not want to sell too early/late, so I was shedding 1k shares a day to be safe. 1k at 70, 1k at 90, 2k at 100 on Tuesday. At this point, I had 3k remaining, and I was hoping that UVIX would maybe rise to 140, but then Trump sent out the tweet that he's basically cancelling the tariffs, which shot the market back up, and plummeted UVIX to 40, luckily I was able to salvage and sell at 56 on the way down. It wasn't quite the finish I was hoping for, but overall, I did get to gain roughly 250k off of my 400k bet.

https://preview.redd.it/k4bzie1sk3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=f788c3fce00964a3a5e9f9202b6db85d3f5bda4a

Now that I've been able to cash out on the big -20% SPY crash I've anticipated, I am completely out of UVIX for now. Even if the market continues to fall, I have full confidence that we'll eventually recover back to our previous 620 ATH, so I'll be DCAing into SPXL/TQQQ from this point on until we reach that price.

https://preview.redd.it/8j48yvnul3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=b68d62402c4fdc3ec905d7c036fcd3cee5ff37f1

In the end, I would not encourage anyone else to do what I did. Even with my conviction and accurate market reading, I had to hold UVIX for 6 months, which ended up being one of the most stressful thing I could do. I've lost sleep, became disillusioned with the economy/government, and absorbed more bad news than I could handle. I've internally cheered for bearish news, despite knowing it could mean hardship for many people.

I was somewhat lucky that Trump did indeed enact his tariffs, otherwise I may have been stuck holding a decaying position until it went to zero or was delisted.

In the end, I'm just relieved that I could finally exit my large UVIX positions, and I will never all-in again the way I did. I hoped you all enjoyed my perspective/story and I wish the best of you luck in navigating this volatile market.",5753

Been lurking for 6 years, finally made a new Reddit account to share this milestone. Started this journey back in 2017 in Robinhood, rode the highs and lows, and at one point even saw my portfolio drop to just ~$1K back in July 2022 (see screenshot #2) . But here we are in 2024, looking at ~$110k and up $47k (~76%) all-time! (Still quite can’t beat the benchmark yet; SPY’s got me outpaced in the long term 🥲)

The Ups and Downs

Looking back, it’s been one heck of a rollercoaster. As you can see in my all-time chart, there were some major dips along the way. The journey wasn’t linear; there were times when I felt like the portfolio was just bleeding out, but I stuck with it, made some strategic moves, and kept adding funds whenever possible. 

After starting with the modest account balance of about roughly 18k back in Q4 2017, I steadily added funds to my portfolio over time, especially after seeing triple digit returns in NVDA, SQ and double digit gains in bunch of blue chip stocks; held some Chinese stocks like Luckin Coffee (before it got delisted from NASDAQ) . Got the account to a decent level.
Then went completely ‘regard’ and got into options 😅. Did well initially then hit the rock bottom reaching as low as $998 (see aforementioned screenshot #2). Added about 9-12k over next few months (see screenshot #3) to be able to trade again. No options but used margin money to almost double my account first. Then, as the bull market kicked in after bottoming out in October 2023, the account continued to rise. Later, I employed slightly more aggressive options strategies to reach my current position.

Key Moves 
The past 18 months have been all about- researching a shit ton (more!) and making mostly informed decisions mixing with some gut feeling, using Reddit (of course), stocktwits, yahoo finance, various research firms, reports, interviews, Fidelity, CNBC, etc

Current Portfolio includes: 
•	PLTR, bunch of Semi stocks including NVDA, TSM.
•	Blue Chips (duh!) 
•	Growth stocks like SOFI, SQ, 
 •	ETFs and a few dividend/yield stocks like QQQ, IJH, XLE, JPEQ, etc. 
•	Credit Put Spreads, LEAPS, CSPs, and CCs
	•	PLTR and semi stocks, plus bluechi
Missed out on a 10x gain on NVDA (sold too early); funny enough never went long on TSLA or got into some of the group’s fav stonks from back in 2020-21 (you know which ones 💪🏽), but holding PLTR since 2020 has been solid.
I also hold stuff long term on other platforms- Fidelity and Webull including most of my PLTR shares. Can’t go full degen and YOLO everything just on Robinhood alone; you gotta diversify 😭

I have consistently been buying $TSLA puts every time it pumps and made decent money but guys, this time it's different. A 13% pump simply due to ""softer tariffs"" makes no sense. $NVDA and the SPY have not been moving like $TSLA this past week. Again, a sudden pump to +4% just before closing is very sus. They are somehow managing to trap the retail virgin. How can a stock skyrocket 13% literally after they announce that they lost 44% sales in Europe? When $INTC reported an 8b loss, it lost 30% valuation in 30 minutes. Intuitive Machine($LUNR) lost 50% valuation because they didn't land something on the moon, idk.

This is not retail investor, This is Elmo and 🥭 cooking up some massive scam which is going to completely cook the retail investor and us, WSB Put buyers.

TLDR: Grandma died 8 years ago. Left me nothing. So I invested my own money. 

Here's why I like Intel:

* 2024 Q1 up 9% YOY
* Intel has been heavily investing and restructuring by building out the domestic foundry business to manufacture semiconductor chips for third party companies.
* With Intel 3 in production, leading-edge semiconductors are being manufactured in the US for the first time in a decade. Intel will regain process leadership as the Intel Foundry continues to grow.
* I think the fact that Intel is positioning itself to be the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the US is massive. The US Gov is heavily prioritizing domestic semiconductor production and thus is heavily supporting Intel as a company with R&D funding.
* If NVIDIA or AMD are ever forced to change manufacturers due to rising tensions/war between China & Taiwan, Intel will likely be a sole or largest manufacturer for NVIDIA and AMD
* Intel has been heavily investing in R&D. 5.9B out of 12.7B of Q124 revenue was invested in R&D.
* Intel is on track to exceed its forecast of 40 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2024
* The Intel Gaudi 3AI accelerator is projected to deliver 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency than NVIDIA H100 on leading AI models.
* Trading at Forward PE of 17.05
* Geopolitical tensions will ultimately work in Intel's favor more than any other company in this industry
* I like the stock and I think its really cheap rn :)",4241

Airlines and Hospitality are high fixed cost Industries( the one you still incur with or without revenue); unless you are operating on a very limited service business model, Low contribution margin and high fixed cost are bad for even small variations in load factor and occupancy rates. Break even point is around 60 to 65 percent annualized load factor or occupancy rates for low cost, higher for middle to upper scale. Airlines flagship survive only because of national pride and government involvement . Also, These industries are good proxies to assess if we are in recession, the depth and if we are recovering. By all adjacent metrics ( skilled/quality mix, the one that pay high price, i.e business customers and meeting incentive conference exhibitions) and leisure customer ( low paying) we are already in recession. It will fully show in other hospitality companies, airlines and other industries in Q2 earnings.

> Microsoft’s security researchers in the fall observed individuals they believe may be linked to DeepSeek exfiltrating a large amount of data using the OpenAI application programming interface, or API, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Software developers can pay for a license to use the API to integrate OpenAI’s proprietary artificial intelligence models into their own applications.

The Chinese upstart said R1 rivaled or outperformed leading US developers’ products on a range of industry benchmarks, including for mathematical tasks and general knowledge — and was built for a fraction of the cost. The potential threat to the US firms’ edge in the industry sent technology stocks tied to AI, including Microsoft, Nvidia Corp., Oracle Corp. and Google parent Alphabet Inc., tumbling on Monday, erasing a total of almost $1 trillion in market value.

> David Sacks, President Donald Trump’s artificial intelligence czar, said Tuesday there’s “substantial evidence” that DeepSeek leaned on the output of OpenAI’s models to help develop its own technology. In an interview with Fox News, Sacks described a technique called distillation whereby one AI model uses the outputs of another for training purposes to develop similar capabilities.

> “There’s substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled knowledge out of OpenAI models and I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this,” Sacks said, without detailing the evidence.

> In a statement responding to Sacks’ comments, OpenAI didn’t directly address his comments about DeepSeek. “We know PRC based companies — and others — are constantly trying to distill the models of leading US AI companies,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in the statement, referring to the People’s Republic of China. “As the leading builder of AI, we engage in countermeasures to protect our IP, including a careful process for which frontier capabilities to include in released models, and believe as we go forward that it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology.”",2366

POET makes optical chips that connect GPUs in AI data centers. Not the GPUs themselves, the networking shit between them. Everyone's throwing money at NVIDIA for the chips but nobody's paying attention to the fact that when you have thousands of these things clustered together they need to talk to each other at insane speeds. That's what POET does, optical interconnects for 800G, 1.6T speeds and up.

So on October 7th (to-fucking-day) they announced they raised $75M. Biggest investment in their history. But here's the thing... they won't say who gave them the money. Just says ""a single institutional investor"" in the press release. No broker, no finder's fee, straight direct placement.

When I saw that I was like wait what? Companies don't usually hide this shit unless there's a reason. And when you do a direct placement with no intermediaries that usually means you already know each other, like this isn't some random fund that saw your pitch deck.

The timing is what really got my attention though. OpenAI announces that massive AMD deal on October 6th, literally the day before. POET just launched their 1.6T optical receivers with Semtech on Sept 30. They got their first real production order in September for over $500K, yeah I know that's fucking peanuts. Their Malaysia manufacturing facility just came online. Everything is happening right now and then they get a mystery $75M investment.

I started thinking about who needs optical interconnects right now. OpenAI is building out 6 gigawatts with AMD and 10 gigawatts with NVIDIA, they absolutely need this shit. NVIDIA has been throwing billions at AI infrastructure companies but they don't have any optical interconnect plays in their portfolio. Microsoft needs to secure OpenAI's supply chain. Amazon and Google are behind and trying to catch up. Every major player in AI needs what POET makes.

And it's not vaporware, Foxconn selected them for their 800G and 1.6T modules. Semtech co-developed products with them and did a joint announcement. They're shipping samples to three major tech companies right now. Semtech wouldn't put their name on it if it was bullshit.

If someone bought 15% of the company, which is about what $75M gets you at $5.50 per share, they legally have to file with the SEC within 10 days. It's called a 13D or 13G filing. The deadline is October 17th. That filing has to show who they are, how much they bought, whether it's passive or strategic, all of it.

So in 10 days we're going to know if this was NVIDIA, OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, whoever. If it's one of them this stock is going to fucking moon because it validates everything. If it's just some random growth fund then whatever. I'm here for the fucking casino.

Now look I'm not an idiot, there's a bear case here. Company has been around since 1972 and they're basically still pre-revenue, they did like $268K last quarter. They've lost $214M over their lifetime. They've raised $227M in the last 2 years alone, constant dilution.

But someone just put $75M directly into this company right as everything is coming together. No intermediaries. Right as production is scaling. Right as OpenAI is making major chip diversification moves. The structure looks exactly like the OpenAI-AMD deal with the warrants out to 2030. Either this is the luckiest timing ever or something's going on.

Position: I like to gamble so I picked up 1,000 $10C 10/31. I'm betting it all on a big partnership.

We've seen a few trends over the last few months where some previously-beat-up tickers went from trash to gold. I'm gonna call this trend ""shit we thought we'd have in the future because we watched a lot of sci-fi movies"". 2024 was the year of AI, then it was the space stocks (RKLB, LUNR, etc). Then it was the flying car stocks (ARCH, JOBY, etc). Then we all saw the quantum stock bubble (though any regard with a CS degree could have told you the same thing that Jensen did). So, what sci-fi future shit is left to invest in? Robots, obviously!

Except, robots, like space rockets, are real. And they're already in market and getting better rapidly. 2025 is the year when they'll really start to go mainstream, largely because software is the biggest limiting factor to how good robots are today. With recent advancements in AI, robots are going to start getting \*A LOT\* better.

Further supporting my bullish thesis is NVIDIA's recent release of their Cosmos Wold Foundation Model  (https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-cosmos-world-foundation-model-platform-to-accelerate-physical-ai-development). Why is this a big deal? because, this will really lower the cost of entry for the robot manufacturers as they won't have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to train a vision model by themselves. Now they can just equip their bots with some commodity sensors & cameras and build out the hardware bot for their use case.

1ibkcex,2025-01-27 22:16:38,Reddit,stocks,"NVDA, GOOGL","Nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in U.S. history","Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.

The chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

The selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. 

Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.”

The analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.”

But after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.

Data center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.

For Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.

Nvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.

CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.

The sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.

Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety.

“I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote.

Nvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.

1k2ys45,2025-04-19 17:25:48,Reddit,stocks,"NVDA, TSLA, GOOGL",The era of American stock market exceptionalism is over,"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/american-exceptionalism-over/?ICID=continue_without_subscribing_reg_first

Nearly three quarters of fund managers think that US exceptionalism has peaked. The prevailing trend of the last decade – a belief in the continued success of US markets far beyond that of other regions – is over, according to the Bank of America’s latest survey.
Over the past two months, fund managers have dumped US equities at a record pace as President Trump’s tariff war and uncertainty over global economic stability continue. For those watching closely, it should not come as a shock, although it has happened perhaps a little faster than anticipated.

While it has come to feel like business as usual, US exceptionalism isn’t the historic status quo. In the 1980s, for example, the rapid rise of Japanese stocks challenged the US dominance of global markets.
Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, explains that ultimately, the stock market bubble was over-inflated and had a long way to fall – a scenario today’s US market is particularly vulnerable to.
One of the most notable pinpricks came at the start of this year with the release of DeepSeek, a sophisticated AI tool developed in China. The extremely cheap development cost of the model has sparked concerns that the AI moat of the American tech giants may not be as wide as had been assumed.

Since 2012, average earnings from US stocks have risen 145pc – over the same period, European and UK markets have each seen earnings increase by just 37pc and 30pc, respectively.

Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan, says: “Technology has been the leading sector globally and the US has been overweight in that sector. In an environment where technology [stocks] have been standout it has been hard for other regions to out perform.”
However, the performance gap between the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia) and the rest of the S&P 500 has narrowed of late. A year ago, the tech giants were outgrowing the rest of the US market by 30pc, a figure that has plummeted to just 6pc. That is expected to halve to just 3pc in 2026.

The upset is apparent in other metrics, too. While the Magnificent Seven accounted for 50pc of the S&P 500’s earnings in 2024, this share is projected to fall to a third for 2025.

All of this adds up to a simple fact: US equities are unlikely to outperform the rest of the world to the extent that they have done in the recent past.
In fact, Mr Stevenson warns they may underperform.
Markets are also becoming suspicious of US government debt, which could have dramatic consequences for the stock market.
Mr Gimber explains: “One of the big parts behind the US economic outperformance is the size of the government deficit that has been running.
“This has been an expansion built on US government debt, and although levels are still rising the market is getting wary of US government debt, especially in the context of inflationary pressure from tariffs.”

🌍 New Political & Tariff Risks – Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.



⚡ Serious Competition is Catching Up – Tesla isn’t the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching—or surpassing—them in innovation.



🚦 FSD is Overhyped – Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.



🔋 Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze – Raw material costs are going up, and Trump’s tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.



🤖 Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent – Even before Musk’s latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla’s AI progress.



🔵 Losing Left-Leaning Consumers – Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.



Tesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs—they were miles ahead of everyone else. But that’s just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.



What do you guys think? Am I being too bearish, or is Tesla in for some rough times ahead?",3346

Shares of the search giant jumped more than 4% on Monday, pushing the company into territory occupied only by Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple.

The stock got a big lift in early September from an antitrust ruling by a judge, whose penalties came in lighter than shareholders feared. The U.S. Department of Justice wanted Google to be forced to divest its Chrome browser, and last year a district court ruled that the company held an illegal monopoly in search and related advertising.

But Judge Amit Mehta decided against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, which sent shares soaring to a record. After the big rally, President Donald Trump congratulated the company and called it “a very good day.”

Alphabet shares are now up more than 30% this year, compared to the 15% gain for the Nasdaq.

The $3 trillion milestone comes roughly 20 years after Google’s IPO and a little more than 10 years after of the creation of Alphabet as a holding company, with Google its prime subsidiary. .

CEO Sundar Pichai was named CEO of Alphabet in 2019, replacing co-founder Larry Page. Pichai’s latest challenge has been the surge of new competition due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which the company has had to manage through while also fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. and Europe.

The rise of Perplexity and OpenAI ended up helping Google land the recent favorable antitrust ruling. The company’s hopes of becoming a major AI player largely ride with Gemini, Google’s flagship suite of AI models.

There is no comparable data from OpenAI but has to be a lot less. OpenAI's total processed tokens are just over 1 trillion. So **per month** Google processes 1300 times more than OpenAI **in three years since 2022 end**. That is huge.

1iej3mb,2025-01-31 17:46:00,Reddit,stocks,NVDA,"AAPL - 26,527.62% return over 25 years","Today to the day is the anniversary of twenty five years of my first purchase of AAPL shares.  I bought 1200 dollars worth.

In early 2000, I had just graduated college.  I had a few thousand given to me as an inheritance that was being managed by a broker.

 I asked the broker about purchasing some Apple shares, and he was unimpressed, and unmoved. I was annoyed at him. Apple was the one I had the strongest impulse to purchase.

 Why apple? I had gone from being skeptical of Apple. My  college was very heavily Mac, but I had PCs.  I was unimpressed at the OS, but I was struck by people’s reactions to Jobs.  He was enthusiastic, and I liked the cut of the jib who liked the cut of his jib. I was drawn to the elitism of the people to the brand, and felt it could bounce back. This was even before iPods, mind you, before OS X.  

These were the days of the dotcom boom. This broker was taking like 500 bucks for every trade. This felt unfair, in light of the great digital democratization that was in progress, I wanted the power.  And E*trade was relatively new and it seemed legit.  I hadn’t done anything like this before, I was just a kid, really, but I decided to just go for it. 

I sold most of the shares I inherited, and threw 1200 bucks into Apple.  `(also a few other, less impressive stocks)' I did marvelously the first few months as the market soared, as did most people. 

And…. it  came tumbling down in April 2000.  Disillusioned, I decided not to try to reposition my shares, and I just let things ride for a few months.  When I rebalanced by portfolio, I kept my apple shares, which had split, despite the pull-back.

Every year, I would consider would I buy more apple now?  And it didn't occurr me to sell. Apple often seemed almost comically undervalued, and I held on or increased my investment in it.

Every time apple goes up 1 point, I get more than my initial investment back. Why? Splits.

•	2-for-1 split in 2000  
•	2-for-1 split in 2005  
•	7-for-1 split in 2014  
•	4-for-1 split in 2020

Nowadays cost basis: .88 cents.     As of today that investment has grown 26,527.62%. I added more and more apple across the years, and had some other lucky calls (my second largest holding is NVDA) but no move matches that whimsical lucky move of 25 years ago today.

The security that owning these securities has offered me is significant.  It has let me have a job that isn’t that well-payed and support my family with emergencies being take of by extra funds. We own a lot of apple products, because with the dividends, it sort of just pays for them.

I do think it’s good to give early adults access to a few thousand dollars to play the market and plan to do that with my own children.  Although I didn’t sell my shares, what I did do is convert a bunch of them to a donor advised fund (avoiding taxes, whee), and I give to charity from that for annual giving, and that feels like a win win win proposition.  

I do feel overexposed in AAPL and NVDA, but due to still hopefully having another at least 25 years to go in my life is that pullbacks eventually come back up. The biggest principle that has guided my investing is “Don’t buy crap if you can help it”, and that's my advice to new investors.",984

1l5vyh4,2025-06-07 23:40:08,Reddit,stocks,"NVDA, TSLA","Earnings up, yields up   is Trump’s $3T bill a bull trap in disguise?","Everyone’s watching the Musk vs. Trump drama like it’s the main event, but markets should probably be paying more attention to what’s actually in Trump’s $3T “big beautiful bill”  because it’s very much alive and moving forward

Despite Musk calling out GOP lawmakers, threatening primaries, and warning about the deficit (which, by the way, multiple analyses say will balloon by $2.4T+), the bill’s still on track. Thune and Senate leadership basically shrugged him off. They’re pushing this thing through  and fast

Here’s where it gets interesting from a market angle:

They're talking about cutting back the $40K SALT deduction to save money. But whatever they save might immediately get canceled out because there's also strong pressure to make temporary business tax breaks permanent  stuff like R&D deductions, bonus depreciation, and interest expensing

That’s a huge deal if you're long big-cap tech, industrials, or healthcare. These tax breaks boost reported earnings pretty directly. If they go permanent, EPS estimates probably move higher without companies having to do anything operationally. Think MSFT, LMT, UNH  names like that

But here’s the tradeoff: the bill’s already inflationary. If they don’t pay for it, bond yields are going to feel it. So while stocks might get an earnings tailwind, valuations could stay capped or even compress further if the 10Y starts creeping above 5% again

And the AI provision buried in the bill? Wild. Originally it said states couldn’t regulate AI for 10 years — a total federal preemption. Now they’re walking that back to a softer “you lose broadband funding if you pass certain laws” version. Doesn’t matter much fiscally, but for megacaps like NVDA and GOOG, this is one less regulatory headache. The moat just got a little deeper

One curveball that could raise the cost: Section 899. It lets the president slap taxes on foreign countries seen as ""discriminatory."" Some senators want to remove it, which could limit future revenue and geopolitical leverage. Not a today problem, but if you're watching defense and energy stocks tied to foreign trade, it matters

And now there's infighting about Medicaid cuts. Josh Hawley’s out here writing NYT op-eds saying this bill punishes working-class voters while handing corporate tax cuts. He’s not totally wrong. If the GOP starts shifting back toward economic populism, how long do these business-friendly tax policies actually last?

So here’s the real market question buried in all this: Are we about to get an earnings boost that the bond market completely wipes out?Because if you’re buying the earnings upgrade but ignoring the debt story  you might be trading the right trend with the wrong multiple",911
1lx6tfx,2025-07-11 15:23:58,Reddit,stocks,"NVDA, GOOGL",Trump posted: ‘The stock market is at an all-time high and interest rates should be cut immediately’!,"Former U.S. President Donald Trump just posted heavy rhetoric on social media, praising tech, industrial stocks and cryptocurrencies for their big gains and strongly calling on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Let's break down what he said and analyze the current state of the market with the latest data. Tech stocks, industrial stocks, Nasdaq hit record highs, cryptocurrencies “break through the sky” Nvidia (NVDA) is up 47% since the tariffs, the U.S. made hundreds of billions of dollars from the tariffs the country came back and called on the Fed to immediately cut interest rates declaring that “there is no inflation” .

How does the market interpret this?

Expectations for rate cuts are heating up: inflation is falling back + political heat is rising in a campaign year, Trump's statement may create some public pressure on the Fed (although its independence remains).

Tariffs negative turned positive? : Despite initial concerns that the market was under pressure, from the perspective of capital rotation, industrial, AI and defense stocks have risen, and it seems that the “Made in the USA” narrative is stronger.

Nvidia became a symbol: as the AI concept leader, NVDA after the tariffs rose against the trend, became the representative of the “no fear of policy uncertainty”, ARM, SMCI, AVGO, etc. also strengthened, the whole AI plate into the “revaluation period”.

Follow-up possible trend?

If the next Fed officials do not rush to suppress the rate cut expectations, the market may be the following scenarios

 Long beneficiary direction: tech giants (NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL), interest rate sensitive growth stocks (ARKK, SMH), industrial/infrastructure stocks (CAT, DE, GE)

Risks to watch out for: QQQ/SPY technicals are close to overheating, Powell or other officials release hawkish letters, earnings season is approaching, and there could be a “positive cash-out-on-decline” 

What do our Reddit friends think?

Do you think Trump is just “rubbing it in” or is the impact of his policies really being priced into the market?

Will the Fed turn dovish under this political pressure?

Even if you don’t think Google will win the AI race to general intelligence or don’t even believe anyone will get there (which is the long term “this stock will absolutely explode if they hit AGI” bet):


let’s just look at valuations:

If OpenAI is valued at $500b then Deepmind is easily $500b. 

If Netflix is $500b then Youtube is easily $700b. 

Search is easily $1-2T. 

Now we are sitting around Googles current $2.5T valuation. 

But there’s more! 

How much is Google Cloud worth? Easily $300+ billion just based on current revenue. 

This is part of cloud but how much is their tensor chip tech alone worth? AI specific compute that’s competitive to Nvidia? Short answer is: a lot. 

If Tesla is worth $1T partly off self driving car hype, how much is Waymo worth? Easily $100-200b. 

How much is the Android/Google Play business worth? 

How much is every app that we all use daily worth? (Chrome, Maps, Gmail, Docs, Drive, etc)


I know this has been said before but Google is literally a competitor to every single major Tech companies business. They have their hands in every single pot. Whilst, they have historically had issues with marketing and selling their product, their product suite *is good*. They don’t just have a useless competitor like bing is to their search, they actually put up real competition like Google Docs is to Word. 

People talk about the risk of Google getting broken up but that might be the best thing for investors. The individual parts of Google are so valuable that forcing the market to value them separately might actually unlock value. It wouldn’t be crazy if a breakup made investors richer, not poorer (at least in the short term). The market would finally have to pull its head out of its ass and price these pieces properly. (Edit: This part is hyperbole to make a point, I don’t actually think a breakup would be good for investors) ",882

DeepSeek Shakes Up Stocks as Traders Fear for US Tech Leadership",">Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek rocked global technology stocks Monday, raising questions over America’s technological dominance.

>Buzz grew over the weekend about DeepSeek’s latest AI model being cost-effective while running on reduced-capability chips, casting doubt on the validity of the sky-high valuations for companies like Nvidia Corp. The Chinese firm’s product, released last week, is now at the top of Apple Inc.’s App Store rankings.

>“DeepSeek shows that it is possible to develop powerful AI models that cost less,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. “It can potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain, which is driven by high spending from a small handful of hyperscalers.”

>Founded by quant fund founder Liang Wenfeng, the app’s underlying AI model is widely seen as competitive with OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc.’s latest. Lauded by investor Marc Andreessen as “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs,” DeepSeek’s assistant shows its work and reasoning as it addresses a user’s written query or prompt. Reviews on Apple’s app store and on Alphabet Inc.’s Android Play Store praised that transparency.

>Nasdaq 100 futures tumbled as much as 1.9%, while contracts on the S&P 500 fell as much as 1%. The moves represent continued losses from Friday’s cash session, as US shares cooled after gains earlier in the week as President Donald Trump took office.

>In contrast, stocks advanced in Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng Tech Index climbing as much as 2% ahead of Lunar New Year holidays this week. Chinese AI-related stocks including Merit Interactive Co. surged by their daily limits. Merit is among those with the clearest links to DeepSeek after stating in an earlier filing that it had incorporated the homegrown AI firm’s model into marketing.

>Meanwhile, shares in the AI supply chain slumped as investors rethink their assumptions that the most advanced AI will require increasing amounts of computing power and energy. Major Nvidia supplier Advantest Corp., slid as much as 8.6% in Tokyo. Data centers shares also slipped, with Singapore-listed Mapletree Industrial Trust down 3.6%. Markets were closed for holidays in Taiwan and South Korea.

>The DeepSeek product “is deeply problematic for the thesis that the significant capital expenditure and operating expenses that Silicon Valley has incurred is the most appropriate way to approach the AI trend,’ said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer and internet at Singapore-based Aletheia Capital. “It calls into question the massive resources that have been dedicated to AI.”

>Kyle Rodda, senior market analyst at Capital.com, says the updated AI model unveiled by China’s DeepSeek raises concerns about geopolitical risks as well as questions about US tech stock valuations.

>The decline in Nasdaq futures comes at the start of a big week for earnings from major tech companies including Apple and Microsoft Corp. Profit growth is expected to have slowed while valuations remain inflated, once again causing concern over the large AI-driven rally in the sector.

>The Nasdaq 100 is trading at 27 estimated forward earnings, compared with its three-year average of 24 times. Nvidia is at 33 times, though that’s slightly down from its three-year average. Shares of Nvidia were more than 3% lower on the alternative trading system Blue Ocean in Asia morning, according to Kok Hoong Wong, head of institutional equities sales trading at Maybank Securities

>The DeepSeek release raises new doubts, challenging the notion that China’s AI technology is years behind US counterparts. Washington’s trade restrictions had kept the most cutting-edge chips out of China’s hands, but DeepSeek’s model was built using open source technology that is easy to access.

>“While current leaders like Nvidia have a strong foothold, it is a reminder that AI dominance cannot be taken for granted,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets. “The emergence of China’s DeepSeek indicates that competition is intensifying, and although it may not pose a significant threat now, future competitors will evolve faster and challenge the established companies more quickly. Earnings this week will be a huge test.”

Nvidia stock was rising early Monday, pushing its market capitalization past Apple's to make the chip maker the world's largest company.

Nvidia shares were up 1.4% at $137.35 in early trading. The stock rose 2% on Friday.

That gave Nvidia a market cap of $3.365 trillion, just ahead of Apple's $3.338 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Continued high spending from big technology companies on artificial-intelligence infrastructure, including the company's Blackwell processors, look to be a more fundamental driver for Nvidia stock.

""We have further raised our big tech capex forecasts following the quarterly results last week. We now expect their combined spending to grow 50% this year to $222 billion, and another 20% to $267 billion in 2025,"" wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a research note.

Intel is set to unveil plans this week to slash more than 20% of its workforce, in a move to streamline operations and reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The layoffs are part of a broader strategy to refocus on an engineering-driven culture, the report said. 

Intel did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The layoffs mark the first major move under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took over last month to revive the struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker after years of challenges.

Last month, Reuters reported that Tan was considering significant changes to its chip manufacturing methods and artificial intelligence strategies.

The new trajectory involved restructuring Intel's AI strategy and implementing staff cuts to address what Tan described as a slow-moving and bloated middle management layer. Shortly after his appointment, he told employees in a town hall that the company will have to make ""tough decisions.""

Last week, Reuters reported that Tan was restructuring the company by flattening its leadership team, with key chip groups now reporting directly to him.

The planned layoffs follow a significant reduction in workforce last August, when Intel said it planned to cut 15% of its jobs, or approximately 15,000 positions.

The job cuts in 2024, part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan aimed for this year, were driven by high costs, shrinking margins in Intel's core PC and data center segments, and an expensive pivot to AI chips - an area where Intel has trailed competitors such as Nvidia.

The Santa Clara, California-based company had 108,900 employees at the end of 2024, according to a filing.

The chipmaker is scheduled to report its first-quarter results on Thursday.",789
1juwlyp,2025-04-09 05:40:02,Reddit,stocks,NVDA,Here’s why I don’t think China will cave,"It's kind of the body of evidence the last ~10 years or so.

First we have the Huawei and BYD situation. We (the US) basically locked some of their biggest companies out of the US market and guess what happened. Huawei took a hit but they came roaring back. They went ahead and dominated all the other markets. 

Then we have TikTok. The US has been pressuring China to sell TikTok for almost half a decade now. Not once have they moved an inch on this. We keep saying the sale is close and keep push it back 75 days. Even if a deal eventually gets done, I bet China's (Bytedance) is still going to own a major stake in it.

Then we had the Nvidia chips ban which was a total flop. Don't sell them the best chips. Well they went ahead and made DeepSeek anyway. What we should have done instead is sell them the chips but add a tariff. We basically forced their hand and now they are making their own chips to rival Nvidia. We inadvertently strengthened their semi production capability by imposing this ban.

And let's not forget COVID. Long after the world opened up because of economic, societal pressure ... China held on to their own detriment. They endured excruciating economic pain in the process, they also had the property collapse. This tells me the country has an unusual amount of tolerance for economic carnage.

OpenAI has agreed to buy tens of billions of dollars’ worth of chips from AMD as part of a deal that could also see the ChatGPT maker take a roughly 10 per cent stake in the $270bn chipmaker over time.

The San Francisco-based artificial intelligence start-up said on Monday it had agreed to purchase processors with a total power consumption of 6 gigawatts, roughly equivalent to Singapore’s average demand.

The companies did not put a total dollar figure on the transaction, but OpenAI executives estimate that 1GW of capacity costs about $50bn to bring online, with two-thirds of that spent on chips and the infrastructure to support them.

The deal comes just a fortnight after AMD’s rival Nvidia announced it planned to invest $100bn in OpenAI, with the two companies pledging to deploy 10GW of new data centre capacity.

AMD has also issued OpenAI a warrant to purchase as many as 160mn shares at an exercise price of $0.01 over time based on AMD “achieving certain share price targets” and OpenAI deploying its chips. That would equate to roughly 10 per cent of the company.

The transaction is the latest intended to accelerate OpenAI’s development of new data centres to train and power its AI models, and to ensure the group’s central position in the race to build the cutting-edge technology.

“This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realise AI’s full potential,” OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said.",725

*″*As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps that will unfortunately result in reducing our global workforce by approximately 4%,” an AMD representative said in a statement. “We are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.”

AMD had 26,000 employees at the end of last year, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

AMD is the second-biggest producer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, behind Nvidia. The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

AMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers, including the MI300X, which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

AMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD’s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024.

GPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD’s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

AMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel. Its share of server CPU sales rose nearly 3% on an annual basis in the third quarter to 34%, according to Mercury Research.

Google says it’s developed a new quantum algorithm called “Quantum Echoes” that apparently runs 13,000 times faster on their quantum chip than the most advanced classical algorithms on a supercomputer.

It’s not just some “look how cool our tech is” moment either.

They’re saying it could help map molecular structures for drug discovery and design new materials ，which, if true, would make this one of the first real-world quantum computing applications we’ve seen so far.

I still remember when they announced the “Willow” chip last year, claiming it solved a key qubit issue. This feels like a continuation of that storyline ，one step closer to commercial use.

Now, obviously, it’s still early and there’s always a ton of hype around quantum anything, but it does make me wonder how this might eventually tie into AI. If quantum chips start boosting AI processing down the line, that could shake up the entire tech stack ，maybe even how we value GOOG compared to NVDA and MSFT.

This is quite the circular economy we got going here. By investing in the deeply unprofitable startup that buys their product, they ensure demand for their products remains strong.

Probably the right move for Nvidia, because a lot of this money will come back to them, and they can sell their hardware at high Margins. And with their stock trading at 50x earnings, it makes sense to spend their cash flow on funding/acquiring AI startups rather than buying back shares.

This all but ensures the  AI bubble keeps going a couple more years, but also inflates it even further. MAG7 is becoming more and more exposed to AI, with cash flows going towards datacenter buildout and training AI models rather than innovation or shareholder returns.",585

In his statement, he bombastically emphasized the importance of copper to the country: copper is the second most used material in the Department of Defense. How can we let ‘sleepy leaders’ destroy this industry? It's time to rebuild America's copper industry. This is our golden age!

What this means for the market (personal opinion): Copper prices could be about to spike (again) Copper (HG=F) has bounced around $4.50/lb last week. Once the tariffs hit the ground, expect importers to stock up ahead of time and copper mining stocks to put in a rally. Focus: Freeport-McMoRan ($FCX), Southern Copper ($SCCO), Teck ($TECK), as well as small-caps Taseko ($TGB), Copper Mountain ($CPPMF).

Risk of rising short-term inflationary pressures 

Copper is widely used in construction, data centers, electric vehicles, power grids, and defense.

50% tariffs = higher costs = could push up cost transmission effects in industrial and tech supply chains.

New energy, EV sectors could be under pressure 

Tesla ($TSLA), Enphase ($ENPH), Azure ($NIO), etc. could face higher raw material costs.

Energy storage and battery businesses will have their margins squeezed if they haven't hedged copper prices in advance.

Defense contractors may be forced to strain 

RTX, LMT, NOC, and others rely on copper for radar, missile, and flight systems.

With tariffs raising domestic copper prices, these companies may either lobby the government or turn to local supply chains.

My personal view: 

Short term? Bullish on copper mining stocks, bearish on rising manufacturing costs 

Medium term? Watch inflation and Fed policy feedback 

Long term? This is clearly a big election year move, with lots of policy variables and no shortage of volatility

Incidentally: if copper prices continue to rise, it may be harder for the Fed to cut rates as a result - a potential impact variable for the stock market as a whole.

Would also like to hear your thoughts: 

Do you think this is a pre-election bluff? Or will Congress really follow through?

Has anyone started laying out copper futures or options yet?

Is this just short term volatility or the beginning of a major style switch in industrial stocks? Not investment advice. Just a guy who stares at copper futures every day like it's an EKG.",589

1nj9v93,2025-09-17 12:54:22,Reddit,stocks,NVDA,China bans tech companies from buying Nvidia’s AI chips,"     China’s internet regulator has banned the country’s biggest technology companies from buying Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips, as Beijing steps up efforts to boost its domestic industry and compete with the US.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) told companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia’s tailor-made product for the country, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.

Several companies had indicated they would order tens of thousands of the RTX Pro 6000D, and had started testing and verification work with Nvidia’s server suppliers, the people said.

After receiving the CAC order, the companies told their suppliers to stop the work, the people added.

The ban goes beyond earlier guidance from regulators that focused on the H20, Nvidia’s other China-only chip widely used for AI. It comes after Chinese regulators concluded that domestic chips had attained performance comparable to those of Nvidia’s models used in China.

Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, told reporters in London on Wednesday that he expected to discuss the chipmaker’s ability to do business in China with Donald Trump that evening during the US president’s state visit to the UK.

“We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be,” he said. “I’m disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out, between China and the US, and I’m understanding of that. We are patient about it.” 

Beijing is putting pressure on Chinese tech companies to boost the country’s homegrown semiconductor industry and break their reliance on Nvidia so it can compete in an AI race against the US.

“The message is now loud and clear,” said an executive at one of the tech companies. “Earlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it’s all hands on deck to build the domestic system.”

Nvidia started producing chips tailored for the Chinese market after former US President Joe Biden banned the company from exporting its most powerful products to China, in an effort to rein in Beijing’s progress on AI.

Beijing’s regulators have recently summoned domestic chipmakers such as Huawei and Cambricon, as well as Alibaba and search engine giant Baidu, which also make their own semiconductors, to report how their products compare against Nvidia’s China chips, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter.

They concluded that China’s AI processors had reached a level comparable to or exceeding that of the Nvidia products allowed under export controls, the person added.

China says Nvidia violated antitrust law when it bought Mellanox

The Financial Times reported last month that China’s chipmakers were seeking to triple the country’s total output of AI processors next year.

“The top-level consensus now is there’s going to be enough domestic supply to meet demand without having to buy Nvidia chips,” said an industry insider.

Nvidia introduced the RTX Pro 6000D in July during Huang’s visit to Beijing, when the US company also said Washington was easing its previous ban on the H20 chip.

China’s regulators, including the CAC, have warned tech companies against buying Nvidia’s H20, asking them to justify having purchased them over domestic products, the FT reported last month.

The RTX Pro 6000D, which the company has said could be used in automated manufacturing, was the last product Nvidia was allowed to sell in China in significant volumes.

Alibaba, ByteDance, the CAC and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Haung has quantified the revenue impact of the U.S. government’s latest move to limit chip exports to China: $15 billion.



Last month, the administration effectively banned Nvidia’s H20 chips to China by tightening chip export licensing requirements to the Asian country. At the time, Nvidia said it expected to take a $5.5 billion charge related to inventory and purchase commitments from the new restrictions for its fiscal first quarter.

“This additional ban on Nvidia’s H20 is deeply painful,” Huang said in a Stratechery interview published on Monday. “We walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably—what is it? — $3 billion worth of taxes” for the U.S.

Critics have said offering Nvidia’s artificial-intelligence chips to China—even one or two generations old—can help companies in China catch up to the U.S. in AI technology. Huang disagrees. He believes the restrictions are shortsighted and will, in reality, help China in the long run.

A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.

The restrictions opens the market in China for increased usage of Huawei’s AI chips, he said. If more companies use Huawei’s chips and the Chinese company can refine its software, Nvidia’s current CUDA software advantage could erode.

“Anybody who thought that one chess move to somehow ban China from H20s would somehow cut off their ability to do AI is deeply uninformed,” Huang said. “If we don’t compete in China, and we allow the Chinese ecosystem to build a rich ecosystem because we’re not there to compete for it, and new platforms are developed and they’re not American at a time when the world is diffusing AI technology, their leadership and their technology will diffuse all around the world.”

The executive also argues by limiting access to Nvidia’s products it forces companies to provide financial resources to Huawei, which the company will then use for R&D to compete with Nvidia.",582

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

Here’s how the chipmaker did, versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended Dec. 28:

Earnings per share: $1.09, adjusted, versus $1.08 expected

Revenue: $7.66 billion versus $7.53 billion

AMD said it expects $7.1 billion in sales in the first quarter, plus or minus $300 million. It projected its gross margin to be about 54%. Analysts expected AMD to guide for revenue of $7 billion.

AMD reported $482 million in net income, or 29 cents per share, for the fourth quarter, down from $667 million, or 41 cents per share in the year-ago period.The company’s adjusted earnings per share excluded items such as acquisition costs, inventory loss at contract manufacturers, and restructuring charges.

Su told investors on an earnings call that AMD believes it will report “strong double-digit percentage revenue and EPS growth” in 2025.

The company’s most important unit is its business selling chips for data centers, which has been growing in recent quarters, thanks to demand for its graphics processing units for artificial intelligence.

AMD reported $3.86 billion in data center sales, which was up 69% on a year-over-year basis. The company said the increase was due to sales both in its Instinct GPUs and its EPYC CPUs, which compete with Intel’s processors.

However, analysts polled by FactSet were predicting $4.14 billion in data center sales during the quarter.

For the full year, AMD’s data center division revenue increased 94% to $12.6 billion. AMD said that $5 billion of those sales were from its Instinct GPUs for AI.

While AMD is far behind market leader Nvidia, it’s released competitive data center GPUs in recent years such as the MI300X, that some big infrastructure buyers, including Meta and Amazon, have embraced.

“We believe this places AMD on a steep long-term growth trajectory, led by the rapid scaling of our data center AI franchise from more than $5 billion of revenue in 2024 to tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue over the coming years,” Su said on the earnings call with analysts.

AMD categorizes its chips for PCs, laptops, and other individual computers as client revenue, which increased 58% on an annual basis to $2.3 billion. AMD said both its chips for desktops as well as mobile computers such as laptops are seeing strong demand.

AMD is also the second-largest producer of GPUs for gaming, behind Nvidia. Revenue in the segment declined 59% to $563 million. The company’s other small division, embedded chips, reported $923 million in sales, down 13% year-over-year.

Shares of AMD rose more than 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how the chipmaker did versus LSEG expectations for the quarter that ended March 29:

* **Earnings per share**: 96 cents adjusted vs. 94 cents expected
* **Revenue**: $7.44 billion vs. $7.13 billion expected

For the current quarter, AMD expects about $7.4 billion in sales with a gross margin of 43%, versus Wall Street estimates for earnings of 86 cents adjusted on $7.25 billion in sales.

AMD’s forecast also included $800 million in costs that the company said it would incur because the U.S. limited the export of some of the company’s artificial intelligence chips during the quarter.

The company reported net income of $709 million, or 44 cents per diluted share, versus net income of $123 million, or 7 cents per share, during the year-earlier period. Revenue grew 36% on an annual basis.

AMD is the second-place server central processing unit vendor, behind Intel, but its Epyc line of processors has been taking market share in recent years.

The company is also the closest competitor to Nvidia for “big GPUs,” or graphics processing units. Those are the kind of chips that are deployed in data centers by the thousands for building generative AI. It did $5 billion in AI GPU sales in the company’s fiscal 2024.

Both are reported in the company’s data center segment, which came in at $3.7 billion in sales, topping a StreetAccount estimate. Data center sales were up 57% on an annual basis, which the company attributed to demand for both Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs.

The company’s other major segment, Client and Gaming, includes chips for consumer devices such as laptops, gaming PCs and game consoles. The overall segment rose 28% on an annual basis to $2.9 billion. AMD said sales for its laptop and PC chips, which it calls client revenue, surged 68% year over year because of strong demand for chips called Zen 5 that the company released last summer.

Gaming sales, however, declined 30% on an annual basis, which the company attributed to a decrease in console chip revenue.

AMD’s embedded segment, which is mostly sales from the company’s 2022 acquisition of Xilinx, declined 3% on an annual basis to $823 million.

The Nasdaq is down 7% this year even after bouncing back some over the past three weeks.

Palantir, founded in 2003 by a group that included Peter Thiel, the company’s chairman, and CEO Alex Karp, has benefitted from a booming government business, which grew 45% to $373 million last quarter. That includes a $178 million contract to build artificial intelligence-enabled systems for the U.S. Army.

In an aminated shareholder letter attached to the company’s earnings report, Karp applauded his company’s controversial defense business and suggested that some former critics in Silicon Valley have “turned a corner and begun following our lead.”

“We note only that our commitment to building software for the U.S. military, those whom we have asked to step into harm’s way, remains steadfast, when such a commitment is fashionable and convenient and when it is not,” Karp wrote.

But investors who want in on the action have to pay up, because while Palantir has joined the top tech ranks by market cap, it’s a far smaller company in terms of sales and profit. Salesforce, the cloud software company that it just leapfrogged, generated over 10 times more revenue than Palantir in the past year, and is expected to do so again over the next four quarters.

That all means Palantir has multiples that are much higher than its large-cap tech peers. Palantir currently trades for 520 times trailing earnings, almost 200 times forward earnings, and 90 times revenue.

“Fundamentals are clearly alive, but we think irrational valuation,” wrote Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies, in a note on May 6. He has the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock.

Among the 10 other top tech names, including Salesforce, the average trailing price-to-earnings multiple is about 58, and it’s only that high because Broadcom and Tesla are both around 160. For forward earnings, the average multiple is roughly 37.5, inflated by Tesla’s 137 figure. And for revenue, the average multiple is 10.2, with Nvidia carrying the highest premium at 22.

Palantir shares slumped more than 12% on Tuesday following first-quarter results. The company topped revenue estimates but showed a deceleration in international commercial sales that spooked some investors. Accelerating growth expectations have also left the company with a high bar to clear.

“You don’t have to buy our shares,” Karp told CNBC’s Brian Sullivan on Wednesday. “We’re happy. We’re going to partner with the world’s best people and we’re going to dominate. You can be along for the ride or you don’t have to be.”

1hyaqje,2025-01-10 19:09:44,Reddit,stocks,NVDA,PSA: just because a stock dips doesn't mean it's on sale. ,"That is, just because a stock is now lower in price than it was a week, month, or year ago doesn't mean it's a good buy today. 

I see this mistake on here constantly, especially in recent years as more casual investors have entered into the stock market. When it comes to indexes, celebrate the dip and buy, absolutely.

*It's a guaranteed recovery as long as a world war doesn't break out and destroy America (we Canadians are ready to check off more of the Geneva checklist if you Yanks try anything funny).* /s 

But for individual stocks? No. The story is different. AI may or may not be a bubble, but it's objectively true that some companies have profited greatly off of their AI investments while others have only made performative moves and have yet to see any real profit.

Quantum computing is another hot area worth mentioning. So many people are tempted to chase what is an obvious bubble. As Jensen Huang said, we aren't even close. It's just gambling at this point, even if a 40% dip makes you feel like you have a ""margin of safety."" 

People have gotten used to infinite V movements. There was a guy in the daily thread for months pointing out how every dip was immediately bought back up. This is not always the case, as we're seeing now. There's no guarantee that a stock will return to ATHs, even if it's one of our beloved bluechips. 

But just because something is now lower in price does not make it ""on sale."" If a banana used to be $100 and is now $50, would you buy it? No! That's still an outrageous price. Find some 10 cent kiwis instead. 

Obligatory AMD comment: yes it was $200. No that price likely wasn't justified. I can't say whether the current price is good or bad, but with a narrow moat and poor performance in a historical semi/data centre run, it's been disappointing. It could absolutely skyrocket again, but that is not promised to you. For many, it is only now approaching a fair value, and for others it needs to dip below 100 or even less to reach that point. Despite being almost 50% from its ATH, it may still just be a $50 banana! 

Anyway, I hope this saves some of you from buying bad companies just because they are down. Be careful out there!

(Reuters) -Nvidia will resume sales of its H20 graphics processing units (GPU) to China and has introduced a new model that complies with regulatory requirements for the Chinese market, the company said on Monday.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-resume-h20-gpu-sales-015010809.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-resume-h20-gpu-sales-015010809.html)",489
1jyohdv,2025-04-14 04:31:39,Reddit,stocks,NVDA,"Trump & Lutnick’s Semiconductor Tariff Chaos: A Bull Trap, Insider Trading, and Market Manipulation Exposed","Alright, Reddit, buckle up because we’re diving into the absolute rollercoaster that is Trump’s tariff policy on semiconductors, spearheaded by his Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. This is a wild ride of mixed signals, market swings, and what smells like blatant manipulation to make billionaires richer while the rest of us get played. If you’re in the markets or just curious about how the sausage gets made in DC, you need to read this. Monday’s announcement is going to be a doozy, and I’m calling it now: we’re staring down a potential disaster for the semiconductor industry, a textbook bull trap, and some seriously shady insider trading vibes.

Let’s start with the Friday bombshell. On April 11, 2025, the **Trump administration** dropped a *memo* that had Wall Street doing cartwheels: semiconductors, smartphones, laptops, and a bunch of other electronics were exempted from the massive “reciprocal” tariffs Trump slapped on China (we’re talking 125% levies—insane). The U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin listed **20 product categories, including memory chips, disc drives, and flat panel displays, all getting a free pass.** Tech stocks like Apple, Dell, and NVIDIA went nuts. The S&P 500 was already down 10% since Trump took office, so this felt like a lifeline. Futures soared, X was buzzing with “bull market confirmed” takes, and everyone thought we were headed for a recovery rally. I mean, who wouldn’t be bullish? It looked like Trump was giving Big Tech a massive break.

But then, Sunday morning hits, and **Howard Lutnick** goes on ABC’s This Week and basically says, **“Psych!”** He clarified that those exemptions? Yeah, they’re *temporary.* Semiconductors and electronics are still getting hit with **“sector-specific”** tariffs in **“a month or two,”** tied to national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. These aren’t negotiable, unlike the reciprocal tariffs. Lutnick’s exact words: “These are things that are national security, that we need to be made in America.” Suddenly, the whole narrative flips. The Friday exemption wasn’t a win—it was a head fake. And now, Monday’s announcement is looming, where Trump’s expected to double down on these semiconductor tariffs, potentially spelling chaos for the industry.

Let’s talk about why this is a big deal for semiconductors. The global chip supply chain is insanely complex. Most semiconductors are designed in the U.S., fabricated in Taiwan (TSMC, anyone?), and assembled or finished in places like China. If Trump slaps tariffs on chips coming from China—or worse, starts a national security probe that messes with the whole supply chain—prices are going to spike. Companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm are going to take a hit, not to mention downstream players like Apple, who assemble iPhones in China. Lutnick’s pushing this “re-shore to America” narrative, but building chip fabs in the U.S. takes years and billions of dollars. TSMC’s Arizona plant isn’t even fully online yet! In the meantime, costs go up, supply chains choke, and consumers get stuck with pricier gadgets—or straight-up shortages.

Now, let’s get to the bull trap. Friday’s exemption announcement was like **catnip for traders.** Everyone piled into tech stocks, thinking the tariff threat was gone. But Lutnick’s Sunday comments yanked the rug out. Posts on X were already screaming about it: “Yesterday’s exemptions weren’t surrender—they were a setup,” one user said. Another called it a “headline-driven market” where the administration is “steering price action.” If Monday’s announcement confirms heavy tariffs, those bullish bets from Friday are going to get crushed. We could see a brutal sell-off in semiconductor stocks, dragging the Nasdaq and S&P 500 down with it. The market’s already been a mess—wildest swings since COVID, down 10% since January 20. This could be the trap that catches all the dip-buyers off guard.

And here’s where it gets really ugly: the insider trading and market manipulation angle. Let’s rewind to April 9, when Trump posted on Truth Social, **“THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT,”** just hours before he announced a 90-day tariff pause for most countries (except China). The S&P 500 surged 9%, Nasdaq jumped 12.2%, and Trump Media’s stock shot up 22%. Coincidence? Democrats like Adam Schiff and Maxine Waters aren’t buying it. They’re calling for SEC investigations, saying Trump’s post reeks of insider trading. Schiff’s letter to the White House asked who knew about the tariff pause beforehand and whether anyone traded on it. When Trump was asked when he decided on the pause, he was cagey: “Over the last few days… probably came together early this morning.” Yeah, right.

Fast forward to this weekend’s semiconductor flip-flop, and it’s déjà vu. Friday’s exemption pumps the market, Lutnick’s Sunday reversal sets up a crash, and Monday’s announcement could be the knockout punch. The timing is too convenient. Billionaires like Bill Ackman, who’s been cozy with Trump but criticized tariffs, are probably sitting pretty, knowing the playbook. Meanwhile, retail traders who went all-in on Friday are about to get smoked. It’s not just Trump’s Truth Social posts—Lutnick’s been all over TV, hyping tariffs one day, backtracking the next. The mixed signals aren’t just chaotic; they’re starting to look deliberate. As one X post put it, “The biggest rally of the year would come on the day Lutnick gets fired.” That’s the vibe right now.

Why does this matter? Because semiconductors are the backbone of everything. Your phone, your car, your fridge—they all need chips. If Trump and Lutnick tank the industry with tariffs, it’s not just stock prices that suffer. Inflation’s already a worry (economists have been screaming about tariffs spiking prices), and chip shortages could make 2021’s supply chain mess look like a picnic. Plus, China’s not sitting still—they hiked their own tariffs to 125% on Friday and are “evaluating” Trump’s exemptions. This could spiral into a full-blown trade war, and guess who pays the price? Not the billionaires with their offshore accounts—us.

So, what’s the play here? Brace yourself. Monday’s announcement could confirm tariffs that gut semiconductor stocks and ripple through tech. If you’re holding NVIDIA or TSMC, maybe hedge with some puts. Cash is king if the market tanks. And keep an eye on X and Truth Social—Trump’s posts are basically market signals now, legal or not. The bigger picture? This administration’s tariff policy is a clown show, and Lutnick’s either in over his head or part of the game. Either way, the semiconductor world’s about to get rocked, and not in a good way.What do you all think? Are we headed for a crash? Is this insider trading staring us in the face?

Drop your takes below—I’m all ears.

**TL;DR:** Trump’s Friday exemption for semiconductors was a head fake that pumped the market. Lutnick’s Sunday reversal sets up a brutal Monday announcement that could crush the chip industry. This smells like a bull trap, with insider trading and market manipulation letting Trump’s billionaire buddies cash in while retail gets screwed. Semiconductors are about to take a beating—watch out.

**Revenue**: Revenue of $46.7 billion, up 6% from Q1 and up 56% from a year ago

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the second quarter ended July 27, 2025, of $46.7 billion, up 6% from the previous quarter and up 56% from a year ago. NVIDIA’s Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially.

There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter. NVIDIA benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory, from approximately $650 million in unrestricted H20 sales to a customer outside of China.

Data Center revenue for the second quarter was $41.1 billion, up 56% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand for our accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative and agentic AI applications. We continue to ramp our Blackwell architecture, which grew 17% sequentially, including our newest architecture, Blackwell Ultra. We recognized Blackwell revenue across all customer categories, led by large cloud service providers, which represented approximately 50% of Data Center revenue.

Data Center compute revenue was $33.8 billion, up 50% from a year ago. Sequentially, compute revenue declined 1%, driven by a $4.0 billion reduction in H20 sales. Networking revenue was $7.3 billion, up 98% from a year ago and up 46% sequentially, driven by the growth of NVLink compute fabric for GB200 and GB300 systems, the ramp of XDR InfiniBand products, and adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions at cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.

**Outlook**  
NVIDIA’s outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows:

* Revenue is expected to be $54.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. The company has not assumed any H20 shipments to China in the outlook.
* GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73.3% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The company continues to expect to exit the year with non-GAAP gross margins in the mid-70% range.
* GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.9 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. Full year fiscal 2026 operating expense growth is expected to be in the high-30% range.
* GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of approximately $500 million, excluding gains and losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities.
* GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.",472

LLMs have hit a plateau. Incremental model versions (GPT 5 for example) are not showing incremental gains. If anything, new versions are kind of acting funny as more and more non-LLM characteristics are being added to them to be able to give a deterministic response (how many Rs in a strawberry🍓).

However, I believe now is the best time to invest. 

I believe things are finally starting to turn ship for Intel. For example - 

* Their 18As have been getting decent yields despite the biased reporting, and look promising. Sure, TSMC is still their biggest rival and ahead of Intel, but Intel can catch up. If they can pluck a few talents from TSMC, or invest greater in their R&D, with US govt chip money backing them, it's possible.
* US government has a vested interest is not letting Intel to fail - it's a geopolitical issue to have cutting edge processor technology in US. If US continues to pump money into Intel just like Taiwan has done for TSMC, Intel can afford to expand its foundries and research cutting edge tech.
* Intel's new Battlemage GPUs seem really cost efficient and there is strong positive sentiment. They will start to gobble up more marketshare and absorb more of Nvidia's AI market as Intel's technology grows in the next gen. This is huge. Nvidia's marketcap is so big that if Intel even eats a bit of the AI market, it will grow exponentially. 
   * Intel's GPU technology looks already promising seeing how they are catching up in drivers and software, and their XeSS technology is ALREADY better than AMD's FSR. 
* They have been getting leaner with mass layoffs and shutting down European plants, and recently reported sell-to-lease transactions. They are cutting costs where they can. 
* Their recent mobile chips - Lunar Lake, have performed fantastic, with high performance and low wattage (which is critical for laptops that suffer under high heat). 

Additionally, if China invades Taiwan, Intel instantly will skyrocket overnight. 

I think Intel has serious potential. It may not skyrocket overnight, but I think this is a long-term purchase and hold with little downsides. When you hit rock bottom, the only way you can go is up.",444

I just feel weird about starting investing when companies are in an all time high.

Not currently invested in stocks aside from my 401k. What my hope are for the future is that companies currently doing research in tech and AI will continue to make breakthroughs and will be the key to huge increases in productivity throughout all industries in the world. That the winners and top companies of today will keep their position 20-30 years from now. It's only logical that companies with money to hire the smartest people in the world will continue to make breakthroughs. I'm not expecting to invest in another nvidia that will make 100,000% gains in 10 years, just that the current top companies with a combined market cap of 10T might be worth 2-3x more 20 years from now.

# Key Takeaways

* Netflix shares jumped Tuesday after a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.
* The streaming giant aims to double its revenue by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday.
* Netflix is set to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.

Netflix (NLFX) shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.

Executives said the streaming giant aims to double the $39 billion in revenue Netflix brought in last year, with a global ad sales target of $9 billion by 2030, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The streaming giant also aims to reach a [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $1 trillion by 2030, the report said, up from roughly $419.2 billion. The only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion today include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B).

Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Tuesday, leading gains on the S&P 500. They've added about 60% of their value over the past 12 months. (Read *Investopedia's* live coverage of [today's market action here](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04152025-11715325).)

Last week, Morgan Stanley analysts named Netflix a [“top pick,”](https://www.investopedia.com/netflix-a-top-pick-for-morgan-stanley-on-expected-resilience-to-a-weaker-market-11712037) arguing the company could be well-positioned to withstand the current tariff landscape. The streaming giant has shown ""momentum” in its core subscription business, the analysts said. That momentum lowers the company’s overall risk, the bank added, even if the advertising market struggles amid rising trade tensions.

1nnytvg,2025-09-22 23:14:53,Reddit,stocks,NVDA,Do you think the stock market is in a euphoric stage right now? I'm slightly scared now..,"I’ve been following some recent data and commentary, and it looks like a lot of indicators are flashing “froth” or even outright euphoria. Like the openAI, oracle, nvidia deals. And the everything AI boom with no earnings to back it yet stocks keep going to the moon. It's crazy.

Retail traders are very active, margin debt is climbing, and there’s a lot of speculation.

On the flip side, earnings growth for big tech/AI names has been strong, and many argue this justifies higher multiples. Also, interest rate cut expectations seem to be fueling optimism.

So I’m curious:

- Do you think we’re really in an “euphoria” stage?

- Or is this just a strong bull run that still has room to go?

- If you believe it is euphoria, what are the signs you’re watching most closely?",421

>Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product decreased an annualized 0.3% in the first quarter, well below average growth of about 3% in the prior two years, according to the government’s initial estimate published Wednesday. Net exports subtracted nearly 5 percentage points from GDP, the most on record, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed.

>Consumer spending — which accounts for two-thirds of GDP — advanced at a 1.8% pace, the weakest since mid-2023. Business outlays for equipment, the lone bright spot in the report, increased an annualized 22.5%.

|Indicator|Actual|Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|GDP|\-0.3%|\-0.2%|
|Personal consumption|\+1.8%|\+1.2%|
|PCE price index, excl. food, energy|\+3.5%|\+3.1%|

>The GDP data highlight the scramble by companies to secure merchandise ahead of expansive tariffs. Looking ahead, many economists anticipate the higher duties will cause a supply shock, challenging businesses and leading to a pullback in demand as higher prices push cash-strapped Americans closer to the brink.

>Forecasters currently see nearly even odds of the US falling into a recession in the next year. Consumers are also growing increasingly anxious that tariffs will take a toll on the labor market and drive up the cost of living.

>The latest GDP figures showed imports surged an annualized about 41% — the biggest advance in nearly five years. Because these goods and services aren’t produced in the US, they are subtracted from GDP. Economists see the sharp widening of the trade deficit reversing in the second quarter.

>Typically, imported merchandise moves into warehouses or directly to storefronts. However, the report showed business inventories contributed 2.25 percentage points to GDP during the quarter, the most since the end of 2021. The recent flood imports may instead show up in higher inventories in coming months and, along with a narrowing trade gap, provide a lift to second-quarter GDP.

>Because swings in trade and inventories can sometimes distort overall GDP, economists prefer looking at final sales to private domestic purchasers for a better snapshot of demand. This measure increased at a 3% pace in the first quarter after rising an annualized 2.9% at the end of 2024.

>Growth in consumer spending was driven by services and nondurable goods.

**My take:** As is commonly said, we haven't even begun to feel the effects of Trump's trade policy yet- shortages of products haven't begun hitting American consumers, but we're going to start feeling the effects this summer. We're likely in for a painful day in the markets today.

I'm mainly interested in consumer discretionary companies to day trade (SBUX mainly) and also watching tech names like SMCI (earnings), NVDA/DELL/AMD (off of the new Deepseek news).

With the Nasdaq suffering its steepest drop since 2022 on Monday, the seven most valuable tech companies lost more than $750 billion in market value. Recession fears and concerns about a trade war drove the selloff.

Apple led the megacap losses, with its value plummeting by about $174 billion. Nvidia shaved off almost $140 billion in market value and shares closed down 5%. The leading AI chipmaker has lost nearly a third of its value just two months after notching a fresh high in January.

Tesla had the biggest percentage loss, with shares of the electric vehicle maker tumbling 15%, their worst day since 2020. The company has lost more than half its value since its stock price peaked in mid-December**.** The stock is also coming off its longest weekly losing streak in history as a public company.

Tesla lost $130 billion in value on Monday, while Microsoft and Alphabet lost $98 billion and $95 billion, respectively. Amazon lost $50 billion and Meta lost $70 billion.

Alphabet and Meta dropped more than 4% on Monday, while Microsoft and Amazon dropped at least 2% each. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell more than 4%, entering correction territory. Shares are more than 14% off their high.

Heavy selling intensified across the tech, with the Nasdaq falling to a six-month low. Many tech companies rely on parts and manufacturing overseas and new levies could push up prices. That’s also sparked worries of a U.S. recession, which Trump didn’t rule out over the weekend.

Semiconductor makers have also felt the pain, with the sector a primary target of new tariffs. Last week, the president announced an additional $100 billion investment from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and called the company the “most powerful” in the world as he looks to boost domestic production.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF has plunged 3% over the past week and is down more than 16% since the inauguration. Heavy selling rattled the sector again Monday, with the ETF last down roughly 5%. Marvell Technology shed 8%, while ASML Holding and Micron Technology slumped more than 6% each. Broadcom fell 5%.

1n3dv7e,2025-08-29 19:35:24,Reddit,stocks,NVDA,Alibaba unveils homegrown AI chip to replace Nvidia’s H20 in China,"No paywall: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-alibaba-develops-ai-chip-090846681.html

(Reuters) -China's Alibaba has developed a new chip that is more versatile than its older chips and is meant to serve a broader range of AI inference tasks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The chip, now in testing, is manufactured by a Chinese company, in contrast to an earlier Alibaba AI processor that was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the report said.

Alibaba did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese tech and AI companies have been focusing heavily on homegrown technology at a time when leading AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) has faced regulatory issues in selling its products in the country.

Nvidia's H20 chip, the most powerful AI processor it is allowed to sell in China, was effectively blocked from sale in the market earlier this year by the Trump administration.

While the U.S. last month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 to China, Chinese firms have been working on processors that could substitute H20. Beijing has also put pressure on tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance, over purchases of the H20 chip.

Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for China following U.S. export restrictions on its other AI processors in 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its Blackwell series.

Alibaba is China's biggest cloud-computing company and is among the top customers of Nvidia.

Separately, on Friday, the company reported a 26% jump in revenue in its cloud computing segment for the April-June quarter, beating market estimates, on the back of solid demand.",365
1nns9dd,2025-09-22 19:07:08,Reddit,stocks,NVDA,Where does the massive Nvidia-OpenAI deal leave Microsoft?,"With the news that Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion into OpenAI, primarily for infrastructure, I'm trying to understand the strategic implications for Microsoft.

For years, Microsoft has been seen as OpenAI's exclusive partner, providing the Azure cloud infrastructure and integrating OpenAI's models deeply into its ecosystem. They had a deal for a huge chunk of OpenAI's profits and seemed to be in the driver's seat.

Now, Nvidia isn't just a supplier anymore; they're a massive strategic investor.

Does this mean Microsoft's influence is significantly reduced? Is their ""special relationship"" with OpenAI over? Are they now just one of two major partners, or does the Nvidia deal sideline them in the long run? It seems like OpenAI is diversifying its dependencies in a big way.

1mzwfjs,2025-08-25 19:11:36,Reddit,stocks,NVDA,NVDA Up 35% Into Earnings,"Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday (Aug 27) after the close, and the setup looks like a textbook high-stakes event. The stock is currently trading at $181.30, up over 35% in the past three months, and the technicals tell a mixed story heading into earnings. On the positive side, the long-term trend is still strong. Nvidia is trading above its 10-day ($179), 50-day ($167), and 200-day ($137) moving averages, which confirms that the uptrend remains intact and the bulls are in control on a broader timeframe.

However, the short-term signals show some cracks. The RSI sits at 73.4, which is firmly in overbought territory. To be clear, this doesn’t always mean the stock will drop immediately, but it does raise the probability of profit-taking in the near term. The MACD has slipped below the signal line (2.92 vs. 4.43), and the histogram has been shrinking since mid-August, indicating fading momentum. Volume has also flatlined while price continued to rise, often a sign that buyers are running out of steam ahead of a major catalyst.

Historically, Nvidia tends to move around ±8% after its earnings announcements. Given the massive run it’s already had this quarter, the risk/reward skews toward the downside. Yes, if Nvidia beats expectations and raises guidance, the stock could break through $190–200 and extend its rally. But with RSI overbought, MACD momentum weakening, and volume drying up, there’s also a real chance of a “sell the news” reaction back toward $170 to 160, even on solid earnings.

TLDR: The long-term trend remains bullish, but in the short-term, Nvidia is priced for perfection. Technicals suggest momentum is tiring, so investors should be prepared for volatility and not be surprised if the first reaction is red before the next leg higher.",368

>

>Trump’s team raised the idea of a deal between the two companies in recent meetings with officials from the Taiwanese chipmaker, the person said, and TSMC was receptive. It’s unclear whether Intel is open to a transaction.

>

>The talks are in very early stages, and the exact structure of a potential partnership hasn’t been established. But the intended result would have the world’s largest made-to-order chipmaker fully operating Intel’s US semiconductor factories, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the conversations are private. It also would address concerns about Intel’s deteriorating financial state, which has forced the company to slash jobs and curb its global expansion plans.

>

>The arrangement may involve having major American chip designers take equity stakes, according to the person, along with support from the US government. That means the venture wouldn’t solely be owned by a foreign company. TSMC is the go-to chipmaker for Apple Inc., Nvidia Corp. and other companies developing semiconductors that power AI algorithms.

>

>TSMC and Santa Clara, California-based Intel declined to comment. A White House representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

>

>Intel shares pared losses on Friday after Bloomberg reported on the discussions. The stock was down less than 1% to $24 as 1:56 p.m. in New York after dropping as much as 5.3% earlier in the session.

>

>While Intel has lost a lot of ground to rivals over the last five years, it still manufactures the most widely used components in the personal computer and server industries. And it has the largest and most advanced production network owned by a US-based company. Those factories have taken on vital strategic importance as Washington works to reverse decades of semiconductor manufacturing shifting to Asia.

>

>Under former Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, Intel embarked on an ambitious and expensive plan to restore its chipmaking lead, and the company won $7.9 billion in US government funding to support projects in four states. It’s also secured $3 billion to produce chips for the US military, all of which will be paid out over time as Intel’s plants hit key milestones. The company has received $2.2 billion as of January.

>

>But that effort has so far failed to attract enough outside customers to make the investments worthwhile, particularly at a new site in Ohio. Intel’s own products also are losing market share, adding to the overall squeeze on its finances — just when it needs to spend heavily. Gelsinger was forced out in December after the board lost confidence in his turnaround plans.

>

>Though Intel has reiterated its commitment to investing in US factories — even as it pulls back from efforts abroad — Washington officials have for months been discussing contingency plans. One option favored by some in the Biden administration was a possible deal between Intel and GlobalFoundries Inc., Bloomberg has reported.

>

>That would have married a maker of older-generation chips with Intel’s leading-edge business. But GlobalFoundries walked away from cutting-edge production years ago and doesn’t have the money for an acquisition, so those conversations didn’t progress much past a thought exercise.

>

>Biden officials also floated the possibility of TSMC licensing its manufacturing technology for use at Intel’s facilities, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations. But TSMC wasn’t interested in an arrangement that could ultimately benefit a competitor, the people said. And Biden’s team was generally reluctant to take an active role in deal conversations, according to several people familiar with the situation.

>

>Trump, meanwhile, is not shy about cutting deals — and TSMC, which just held its board meeting in the US for the first time, is eager to maintain good relations with the new president.

>

>Trump has repeatedly accused Taiwan of “stealing” the US chip industry and threatened tariffs on foreign-produced semiconductors. He’s expressed a preference for using those kinds of levies to boost US chipmaking instead of government subsidies — the approach adopted by the US Chips and Science Act. That legislation, passed in 2022, led to TSMC winning $6.6 billion in grants to support three plants in Phoenix.

>

>

>But it was also Trump’s first administration that set out to lure TSMC to the US, and top Trump officials have consistently affirmed their commitment to boosting domestic manufacturing. That’s particularly true for technologies at the heart of the US-China competition.

>

>The US “will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the US with American-designed and manufactured chips,” Vice President JD Vance said during an AI summit in Paris earlier this week.

>

>The fact that TSMC is open to an Intel deal indicates a change in tune from just a few months ago. In October, CEO C.C. Wei had told analysts that his company wasn’t interested in acquiring Intel’s factories.

>

>Asked the same question again in January, Wei didn’t directly answer: “They are our very good customers,” he said. “I like them and they are very important to TSMC’s business also. That all I can say.”

Yesterday, a video surfaced on X, of a Chinese entrepreneur bragging about getting 200 NVIDIA H200 GPUs despite the export ban, claiming that he's done so for the past 5 year.

But where the story gets really interesting is when the video shows him pulling the NVIDA H200s out from a fresh delivery, which clearly shows $SMCI logo on the boxes he received...

https://preview.redd.it/di3dhpvf6vfe1.png?width=1249&format=png&auto=webp&s=a958013deb8bf7b78988c8b6b3918e733a99a43f

Now before any $SMCI bulls go panic-denial mode, let's put this into context:

* \*\*2018:\*\*$SMCI gets yeeted off Nasdaq for ""losing"" its financial statements. 
* **2020: SEC Slapdown:** $17.5 million fine for widespread accounting violations. The bill is paid, and 3 months later $SMCI rehires the same execs directly involved in the fraud numbers
* **2024:**
   * Hindenburg drops a DD bomb, accusing them of *still* mishandling their numbers, even accusing SMCI of ""violations in US export bans""... interesting
   *  Ernst & Young resign as SMCI's auditor after raising concerns about the company's accounting practices, board management... maybe they picked up on rumors of an additional revenue stream that was hidden in the books as well, who knows.
* **Lawsuits, Lawsuits Everywhere:** Ex-employees whisteblowers continue reporting falsified revenue numbers and other sus accounting practices. 10-k gets ""misplaced"", nice one

And now this video. Definitely not the PR $SMCI needs right now.

Could this be a coincidence? Unlikely. But sure, let's assume $SMCI is just an innocent pawn in this Chinese GPU smuggling game without ever realizing, the accusation alone could trigger a huge sell off. DeepSeek's roll out sent a wake up to the US: we've lost the lead in our own game. The China-US Ai competition has now taken central focus of the government and stock market alike, so imagine how this news will impact an already-beaten down stock with new accusations cropping up each week.",369

In the last 2 months we had massive selling:

Peter Theil: - 24,000,000 shares

Alex Karp: -37,000,000 shares

Stanley Drukenmiller: -729,000 shares

Plus every other executive at the company.

1lw0ltf,2025-07-10 03:46:40,Reddit,investing,"NVDA, TSLA",Today I made $1m gains by selling my entire Nvidia portfolio,"Today marks perhaps my greatest investing milestone of all time!  The short story is I bought $36,000 worth of Nvidia over the course of 8 years. Last year I told myself once my account breaks $1m profit, I will sell the entire position, lock in the gains, and have a hell of a story to share for life.  Well today Nvidia hit a new all time high and I made that dream come true.

Below is a long version of how it all came to be: 

I first acquired Nvidia back in Feb 2017 and in a few lump sum purchases wound up with a total of 6,500 shares of NVDA.  My first purchase was for 1080 (in honor of my GTX 1080 I bought that year) and the share price at the time was a whopping $2.77!  My total investment around this time was $4000.  

Edit: I looked up the actual purchase numbers and the number of shares was actually 27 at $110 but since Nvidia had split multiple times, the number shown in my report today was reflecting those splits.  End of edit 

Back in 2017 all the talk was about Crypto mining and I naively thought Nvidia was the way Bitcoin would be mined forever so I bought into the mantra “during a gold rush, buy the company selling the shovels”.  This was around the time BTC hit $20,000 for the first time but it quickly collapsed and I was introduced into the volatility of the crypto world.  But I still held my Nvidia because I believed crypto was still at an early adoption stage.  

Over the next few years I continued to buy small amounts of Nvidia, in chunks of 100 shares here, 900 shares here, and eventually had 6,000 shares by 2019.  The average cost of all of these were around $2-$8 in today’s value.  

2019 is a significant milestone for me because I made a major life decision to move to Puerto Rico.  This move was made for several reasons but one consideration is the 0% tax on capital gains from stock sales.  I didn’t consider Nvidia being the one stock to move for but one reason for selling the whole lot was to lock in the 0% capital gains today 

I remember somewhere around 2019-2020 starting to think that GPUs and Nvidia specifically weren’t going to be tied to crypto as much as it would be the hardware needed to power self driving cars.  The hype around Tesla was growing and crypto mining started moving away from personal computers and I learned GPUs were falling out of favor for more powerful ASIC mining rigs.  So my mentality moved from Crypto to Electric Vehicles.  Keep in mind, I really didn’t know a lot about any of this and I view my Nvidia convictions at the time more as luck looking back.  

Then in 2020 the Pandemic hit and we saw major sales of GPUs for gaming, virtual reality, and supply chain disruption and of course massive inflation.  Stocks across the board were super volatile but in general things went bonkers in the tech sector.  Tesla was killing it and Nvidia might have doubled during this time.  It still had not gone parabolic yet but I still just kept holding onto my initial position.  My portfolio wasn’t really moving in any major way yet and in early 2019 I was actually slightly negative in my total Nvidia investment.  

Then in 2023 we saw the first mainstream use cases for Ai started popping up.  I’m in the photography and videography world so I noticed how disruptive image and video creation would be as soon as it hit.  All my colleagues were making images in Midjourney when the majority of my non photo friends had no clue what Ai image generation even was.  It ballooned quickly and that’s when my mind set changed a third time. Now Nvidia was going to be needed for data centers and personal computers to power this new Ai revolution.  It wasn’t about crypto or self driving cars anymore, it was about perhaps the biggest innovation humanity has seen since the internet was launched and the iPhone was revealed.  

Seemingly overnight my portfolio was sky rocking.  Where just a few years prior, Nvidia was in the red for me, it quickly started carving out a large portion of my portfolio.  Once a liability, Nvidia now made up 10%, 20%, and 30% of my entire investment account and retirement funds.  There were days when I would log in to see I had made $100,000 that day and a week later it would swing down -$105,000.  It was pretty crazy to see a full year’s worth of income bouncing around day by day in my account.  The temptation to sell had always been there since 2017 when I was up 20-100% but now I was up 4,000% and the temptation was even greater.  Every single one of my friends was telling me I had to take profits off the table.  I wound up holding.  

The last major purchase I made was in July 2021. I bought 400 shares for $14 which at the time was 3-5x what I had bought previously.  

Jump to June 2024 when Nvidia hit an all time high of $130.  My wife and I had just had our first child and my Nvidia position was hovering around $800,000 in total gains.  I knew I only had to make it to $160 per share to break the $1m mark and I told myself I would sell everything if that happened.  Of course the next month Nvidia corrected pretty hard and the reality of hitting $160 didn’t seem possible until July 3rd 2025, nearly a year after I made my original decision to sell.  

I should have sold everything on July 3rd but I didn’t realize the trading day was shortened for the 4th of July holiday coming up. I also didn’t setup any automated sell triggers since I wanted to ceremoniously do the trade myself.  It worked out in my favor as I was able to sell today at $163 and make a little more than the $1m cutoff I originally set to sell at. 

Here are the raw numbers:

Total invested: $36,352
Total sale: $1,059,591
Total gains: $1,023,238
Average cost per share: $5.60
Time to materialize: 8 years and a lot of emotional rollercoasters!


I know a lot of people get caught up in fancy investment options that feels more like gambling but hopefully this success story inspires those of you who are like me and just what to buy shares, hold them, and eventually offload them when the time seems right.

1j9ygro,2025-03-13 00:46:22,Reddit,investing,"NVDA, TSLA, GOOGL",Remembering stock market crash of 2022,"It’s easy to forget how short the market’s memory is.

Still remember the last few months of 2022. The S&P 500 was down nearly 25%, the Nasdaq had crashed over 35%, and inflation was out of control. The Fed was hiking rates aggressively, and it felt like a deep recession was inevitable.

Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan (don't remember which) predicted the S&P 500 would go all the way to 3,000. Michael Burry suggested an even bigger collapse taking S&P500 back to 1800. Most investors were convinced this was just the beginning of more pain. Even then people talked about stagflation and going into the lost decade.

Meta, in particular, was the poster child of despair. Down 75%, from $380 to $88. People genuinely thought it would never recover. The ad market was dying. Reels weren’t making money. Zuckerberg was ""burning billions"" on the metaverse. Investors wanted him to shut it all down.

It wasn’t just Meta. Amazon reported its first unprofitable year after a long time. Google’s ad revenue shrank. Microsoft’s growth slowed. Tesla was down to $113 at its lowest. Institutions were slashing price targets left and right. Investors were selling at the lows, convinced things would only get worse.

And then... the market did what it always does. Slowly, things started improving. Companies adapted. Earnings stabilized. The panic faded. By mid-2023, inflation was cooling. The Fed hinted at pausing rate hikes.

Meta posted a solid earnings report. Then came $40 billion in stock buybacks. The stock doubled. Then doubled again. Amazon recovered. Nvidia went on a historic run. The Nasdaq had its best year in two decades in 2023. By early 2024, Meta, Nvidia, and Microsoft were hitting all-time highs to reach even higher by end of 2024. Two years of record gains.

When markets are crashing, it feels like they’ll never go up again. When they’re at all-time highs, it feels like they’ll never go down. Neither is true.

So investors, it's going to be fine. Just be calm and hold tight. And if you can, keep buying.",2462
1ibf2mt,2025-01-27 18:44:35,Reddit,investing,NVDA,Markets are Overreacting to DeepSeek,"The markets are overreacting to the DeepSeek news. 

Nvidia and big tech stocks losing a trillion dollars in value is not realistic. 

I personally am buying more NVDA stock off the dip. 

So what is going on?

The reason for the drop:  Investors think DeepSeek threatens to disrupt the US big tech dominance by enabling smaller companies and cost-sensitive enterprises with an open source and low cost, high performance model. 

Here is why I think fears are overblown.

1. Companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and other big tech firms have massive war chests to outspend competitors. Nvidia alone spent nearly $9 billion on R&D in 2024 and can quickly adapt to new threats by enhancing its offerings or lowering costs if necessary.

2. Nvidia’s dominance isn’t just about hardware—it’s deeply tied to its software ecosystem, particularly CUDA, which is the gold standard for AI and machine learning development. This ecosystem is entrenched in research labs, enterprises, and cloud platforms worldwide.

3. People have to understand the risk that comes with DeepSeek coming out of China. There will be major adoption barriers from key markets as folks worry about data security, sanctions, government overreach etc. 

4. US just announced $500b to AI infrastructure via Stargate. The government has substantial resourcing to subsidize or lower barriers for brands like Nvidia.

Critiques tend to fall into two camps…

1. Nvidias margins are going to be eroded 

To this I think we have to acknowledge that while lower margins and demand would impact the stock both of these are speculative. 

Increased efficiency typically increases demand. And Nvidias customers are pretty entrenched, it’s def not certain they will bleed customers. 

On top of that Nvidia’s profitability isn’t solely tied to selling GPUs. Its software stack (e.g., CUDA), enterprise services, and licensing deals contribute significantly. These high-margin revenue streams I would guess are going to remain solid even if hardware pricing pressures increase.

2. Open source has a number of relative advantages

I think open source is heavily favorited by startups and indie developers (Open source is strongly favored by Reddit specifically). But the enterprise buyer doesn’t typically lean this way.

Open-source solutions require significant internal expertise for implementation, maintenance, and troubleshooting. Large enterprises often prefer Nvidia’s support and commercial-grade stack because they get a dedicated team for ongoing updates, security patches, and scalability.",2301

1makcxw,2025-07-27 13:50:51,Reddit,investing,NVDA,What I found fascinating while reading Jensen Huang’s biography,"I read Jensen Huang's biograph lately(The Thinking Machine) and I found some interesting stories in it. I wanted to share with you. 

1.When Jensen Huang immigrated to the U.S. as a kid, he ended up in a small rural town and got bullied pretty badly. But instead of reacting with defiance or lashing out, he just smiled and brushed it off. Calm and quiet resilience.

He later said he got into physical training thanks to a roommate, and he started doing tons of push-ups. Eventually, his build changed and that might’ve naturally put an end to the bullying.
	
2.He was really good at table tennis. He seriously considered going pro during his school years. Even after founding NVIDIA, he kept a ping pong table in the office, tucked away in the corner.

3.He’s always been this upbeat, warm-hearted kind of guy. He didn’t like cutting people loose. That’s why NVIDIA’s hiring process was notoriously tough. His philosophy was that if you hire carefully, you won’t need to fire.

At a public meeting one day, he pressed a junior employee, asking, “What value are you delivering here at NVIDIA compared to what you’re paid?” The guy was crushed by it. But later, when that same employee was diagnosed with a rare illness, Jensen tried to cover his treatment personally from his own pocket.

4.He wasn’t like this back in his AMD days, but once he became a CEO, “Hwaung's rage” became a thing. Not in a toxic but more like explosive passion when he disagrees with something. People say that ""If you’ve experienced his rage, you’ve become part of the inner circle at NVIDIA""

5.Around 2014(I don't remember exactly) a junior engineer who was lazy but quite creative noticed a potential link between deep learning and NVIDIA chips. Despite having a relatively low performance record, the guy went straight to Jensen and pitched his idea with everything he had. Maybe he figured he had nothing to lose.

Jensen listened. Then he ripped the roadmap off the wall and declared, “This is our future.”
From that moment on, NVIDIA bet everything on AI. CUDA became the heart of their strategy, and they poured everything into developing GPUs optimized for machine learning.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

You see, a successful business is not determined by how advanced the technology is, but by its ability to generate a pile of money. Business, first of all, is a cash generator. And we, as investors, want to own great cash generators. The problem with quantum stocks is that none of them are great businesses (aside from maybe IBM and Google, which aren't really ""quantum stocks"").

Let's put aside the complexity of quantum computing and how difficult it is to scale. Let's assume we've solved all technical issues. Do you know how much it costs to build and maintain a quantum solution? Do you know how much it would cost to develop commercialized mass-manufacturing? To educate the personnel? The answer: a freaking unimaginable amount.
  
There's no company in Taiwan that will print you quantum chips on demand. There aren't millions of quantum engineers and software programmers waiting to be employed. The infrastructure does not exist. Quantum technology won't be scalable for decades - maybe half a century.
  
You can't even compare quantum to the AI revolution. AI is still silicon-based and can reuse existing infrastructure. Quantum technology reimagines our entire approach to computing from scratch. And it costs a hell of a lot of money (tons of debt, none of profit).

None of the companies on the market will dominate the quantum space. They're not businesses - they're research labs (and some are scams). The companies that will eventually build infrastructure, hire engineers, and scale to the market don't exist yet.

Technology doesn't mean business. Research doesn't mean cash. And sadly, even established companies with fully built infrastructure and strong brands can fail as businesses (sorry, Intel, I'm talking about you).

See how absurd it is that current quantum stocks already have billions in market cap, sitting alongside successful businesses? These companies print flashy news releases and talk big about how quantum will change everything. They exploit public ignorance about technology to sell wet dreams stuffed with money bags. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Your money will soon end up in the pockets of insiders and hedge funds.

This is a reality check not just for quantum stocks, but for tech hype in general. Think twice where you put your money. Maybe it's better to take your profit, consider yourself lucky, and buy your girlfriend flowers or a house?

Not investment advice, of course, but I'd rather put a smile on a girl's face than invest in quantum. ;)

P.S.
When in doubt, trust fundamentals, not your biases. Don't fool yourself into thinking you would've picked Nvidia in 2015 if you only had the information available in 2015. Today is the same - you don't know who's going to be the champ in 2035. It will surprise us all. ",789
1inu9y7,2025-02-12 17:02:59,Reddit,investing,"NVDA, TSLA, GOOGL",Is the Tesla Bubble about to pop?,"I’m not a Tesla expert, and I’m sure many of you have deeper insights into the company, but after watching the latest developments, I have some concerns that I wanted to share as a long time holder. Tesla’s stock is sitting around $330 per share, up 75% from last year, but I’m struggling to see how it justifies the current valuation.

Here’s a list of what bothers me:

1. **Elon Musk’s PR Nightmare** – It’s hard to ignore how much Musk’s public image has deteriorated. Between the “Sieg Heil” incident on live TV and his controversial actions, he’s lost a lot of credibility, and by extension, Tesla’s brand has taken a serious hit. A lot of people now see him and the company as 'problematic'.

1. **Competition Is Catching Up Fast** – Tesla used to be the only game in town when it came to EVs and FSD, but that’s no longer the case. Other automakers are making significant strides in both areas, and some are already ahead in terms of technology and innovation.

1. **Declining Profit Margins** – Tesla’s profit margins have been shrinking year after year. This is concerning for a company that’s valued at over a trillion dollars. If this trend continues, it could put a major dent in their long-term prospects.

1. **The Cybertruck Disaster** – The Cybertruck was supposed to be Tesla’s next big thing, but it’s turned into more of a meme. The build quality issues and the general lack of progress on the product have made it a major disappointment, and it’s starting to look like a marketing gimmick more than a groundbreaking vehicle.

1. **Full Self-Driving Tech Overhyped** – Despite the constant chatter about robotaxis, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still stuck at Level 2-3. Other companies have already rolled out Level 4 autonomous vehicles, making Tesla’s claims look more like wishful thinking at this point.

1. **Political and Tariff Risks** – Tesla’s business is exposed to a number of external factors, from steel and aluminum tariffs to an anti-EV U.S. President. Plus, with a California governor who openly opposes Musk, there’s a real risk of losing state EV incentives, which would hurt sales.

1. **Raw Material Costs Are Rising** – Tesla is also facing increasing raw material costs, and tariffs on batteries imported from China could push those prices even higher. With profitability already under pressure, this is something that could really squeeze margins going forward.

1. **Struggling to Attract AI Talent** – Tesla’s ability to innovate in AI seems to be stalling. The company is having trouble attracting top AI talent, with many researchers opting to join OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and other big tech companies. This could set them back in the long run, especially as competitors accelerate their own AI developments.

1. **Losing Support from Left-Leaning Consumers** – Tesla’s alignment with Musk’s political views has alienated many left-leaning consumers, who are typically more inclined to purchase EVs. This shift in consumer sentiment could hurt Tesla’s market share, especially as alternatives to Tesla grow.

I used to think of Tesla as the Nvidia of EVs, miles ahead of everyone else. But right now, it feels like they’re slipping, with more and more companies closing the gap. Like probably lots of you (well, at least those on TikTok) I’ve been using the trademind AI a lot recently, and that also has TSLA as a clear red flag to sell now. With all these issues piling up, I really struggle to see how Tesla maintains its $1.1 trillion valuation.

What do you think? Am I missing something, or is Tesla headed for some rough times ahead?",698
1lxb0m0,2025-07-11 18:13:44,Reddit,investing,NVDA,Advice for what to do with my Nvidia stock.,"Thanks in advance for any advice, ya'll.

About 10 years about I randomly bought $800 in Nvidia. Today it's worth about $240,000. This is by far the biggest win I've ever had and is AMAZING. I've stuck it out through the big ups and downs with this stock, and am glad I did. But the longer I'm in, and the more it grows, the more I fear a loss. I'm looking for advice/perspective on what to do with this stock and if/when to sell. Here are the relevant pieces of information:

* I'm late 30's, so I still have a decent runway for investing for retirement, though I'm working to retire early.
* My Nvidia stock represents almost half my current portfolio. Having that large of a percentage in one stock makes me nervous.
* I feel like I should sell some Nvidia (not all) to simply diversify my portfolio, but the longer I stay in... the more I've made. And of course there are so many predictions out there on where this stock will go. So it feels like that is a bad choice.
* Edit to add: this is in a taxable brokerage account

What would you do? Stay on the Nvidia roller coaster? Sell all? Sell some (how much)? Other pieces of advice???

1h28t5b,2024-11-29 00:44:37,Reddit,investing,"NVDA, TSLA, GOOGL",Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving,"My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.

Does hearing that such a substantial portion of revenue is concentrated in 3 customers worry you? 

I know very little about the industry. I’ve heard, however, that both Amazon and Google are creating their own custom chips. If they scale up their chip-making operations, it could lead to needing to purchase less GPU’s from Nvidia. 

Also, making up such a large part of sales, doesn’t this give them increased bargaining power? It would seem that these companies are in a position of leverage to negotiate better pricing from Nvidia, which could reduce margins. 

Lastly, there’s a question of competition. Again, I don’t know much, but it seems that Intel and AMD are aggressively improving their AI hardware offerings. If they gain market share, Nvidia’s largest customers could look to start diversifying their suppliers.

if demand is truly about to “double,” why would the biggest ai chip supplier on the planet be guaranteeing empty racks?

answer: current demand is uneven. frontier labs (openai, meta, etc) are burning compute, but enterprise adoption is way slower. workloads are lumpy. nvidia is hedging against slowdown *right now*.

p/e represents the multiple that investors pay for each $ of company earnings

1mku4or,2025-08-08 14:41:21,Reddit,investing,NVDA,Opinion: Investing in semiconductors is riskier than most think and many are ignoring the elephant in the room,"I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how much optimism there is around semiconductor stocks, especially names like TSMC, ASML, Nvidia, etc. The fundamentals look great. AI is booming, chip demand is exploding, margins are strong, and innovation keeps accelerating.

But there's one huge risk that’s consistently downplayed by investors: TSMC’s geographic exposure to Taiwan, and more specifically, the growing possibility of a Chinese invasion.

Most investors seem to consider it highly unlikely. But if you listen to defense experts, geopolitical analysts, and even governments, they see it as a real risk with real probability. This isn’t just noise or fearmongering.

TSMC is one of the most important companies in the global semiconductor supply chain. If conflict breaks out in the Taiwan Strait, it won’t just be bad for them. It could disrupt the entire industry. ASML would lose a key customer. Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and Qualcomm would all be cut off from advanced chip supply. And yes, TSMC is building fabs in the US and Japan, but those won’t match Taiwan’s capabilities for years.

The bullish projections for the chip sector almost always assume political stability around Taiwan and China. But what if that assumption fails?

I’m not saying semiconductors are a bad investment. They’ve been some of the top performers over the past decade. But I do think many portfolios are overexposed to this single point of geopolitical risk.

We can’t predict macro events. But we can choose how much risk we take. Personally, I try to avoid putting too much weight in the chip sector. I prefer companies that would be less impacted if a worst-case scenario plays out. Sure, the returns might be lower, but so are the potential losses.

Just some thoughts. Curious to hear how others are thinking about this. Is the market underestimating the Taiwan risk?",181

It brought forward a lot of interesting perspectives on the bull and bear side and I learned a good bit.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m60b98/i\_have\_to\_be\_missing\_something\_about\_the\_ev\_space/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m60b98/i_have_to_be_missing_something_about_the_ev_space/)

Today, I am posting a similar question about AI and how I dont understand the investments we are seeing in AI and more importantly, where does the ROI on this investment come from?

I dont think I am putting any opinion out there that isnt already known/debated, but my views on AI are pretty straightforward:

1. AI has the potential to revolutionize how we live and can disrupt countless industries and long term, will be a huge benefit for society
2. Like the Industrial Revolution, this disruption will not be met with cheers and excitement. People will be nervous about losing their jobs, wealth inequality being driven further and further, and a deep mistrust of institutions
3. A large majority of the AI investment by big tech is being driven by advertising revenue/cash flow. If we enter a recession or that advertising demand dries up, how much will these large companies be willing to leverage their balance sheets. Look at how much Zuckerberg already has with Meta.
4. Most of this investment will never see a return much less an adequate return on investment. Its very different than the dotcom bubble. With the innovation of some of these chips/hardware, some of this AI investment will quickly become obsolete.
5. From an accounting perspective, it feels like companies are understating expenses like depreciation/amortization which will further drive down profits. Plus, these business ""relationships"" you see between Open AI, Oracle, Nvidia, etc... is it just glorified ribbon cutting? Is any value being driven through these deals besides seeing the 5-10% bump in your stock price the next day? It seems the whole industry is mostly just signing deals between 5-6 companies and moving money around on a spreadsheet. 
6. China is just as much in this arena as we are. Back in the dotcom era, American Exceptionalism drove a lot of the investment in the US in the late 90s because there werent great alternatives. In today's world, that isnt the case. You have a China competitor that has proven it cant just go toe-to-toe with you, but can straight up beat you. If this race comes down to building, the US will lose. We already have lost the great energy race of the 2010s and is there any doubt that China will do what China always does? Drive margins down, reduce profitability, and ensure only the fittest survive. In todays market, you have Chinese tech companies that can compete with the Google, Meta, etc.
7. History suggests that the dominant players today might not be the dominant players of tomorrow. Part of that is not innovating and getting beaten by a smaller and more nimble version. Part of it is making poor investment, rushing to a gold rush with no gold, and eliminating any flexibility you had.
8. I see dozens of companies throwing billions at this AI infrastructure - data center build, components to cool the data centers, chips, nuclear energy, etc. How many of these companies completely lose out and see a 90% draw down like the past cycles such as electric vehicles (Tesla aside).
9. We dont have the power grid in the US to handle this new generation of AI investment. I read and hear good things about expanding the grid, SMRs, and that's great, but does anyone actually expect us to build all of this energy? Im pretty sure China builds more energy capacity in a month than we have in years. That isnt an easy trend to reverse.
10. How does the US government help/hurt this? Increased state regulation? Limiting immigration of top AI researchers/entrepreneurs? Slow rolling electric power expansion? Picking winners and losers and disrupting the free market?
11. Will American companies focus on every day improvements to life or these content creating opportunities in AI. I saw Open AI launch a new thing with virtual content creating and that's great, but I have to admit, i asked myself, is that really the best the best minds in AI can do? Are American companies going to go for the easiest marketable and content creating areas of AI instead of the truly ground breaking areas? Will that area be dominated by China?

This has become kind of a rant, and I apologize, but I am just curious. How do you see the AI cycle and how are you playing it? Im looking at companies that have been beaten up due to AI fears and selling call spreads, and other option players to take advantage of these high flying companies. I never short companies like AI high-fliers.",163

Nvidia Stock Is Falling. Not Even Chip Exemption Saves It From Broad Slump.

2:28 PM-Apr 3

NVDA

By Adam Clark

Nvidia looks set to fall sharply following President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports to the U.S. The chip maker escaped specific levies but the wider market reaction and fears of Chinese retaliation are set to drag on the shares.

Nvidia shares were down 3.2% at $106.93 in the Thursday premarket having tumbled 5.7% at $104.15 in after-hours trading. The stock rose 0.3% during Wednesday's session.

The tariff announcement wasn't quite as bad as it could have been for Nvidia. Trump said the levy on imports for Taiwan - where Nvidia's chips are mostly manufactured - will be set at 32%. However, the White House published a fact sheet after Trump's announcement that said semiconductors would not be subject to that reciprocal tariff.

That doesn't mean chip tariffs are off the table entirely. Products such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and lumber will be addressed separately, a senior administration official said.

The other major concern is likely to be potential retaliation from Beijing, with Chinese goods now facing total duties of 54% after the latest tariff announcements.

Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices fell 5.8% in after-hours trading and Broadcom was down 6.3%.

Meanwhile, Nvidia on Wednesday said its Blackwell computing platform set performance records in tests for inferencing - the process of generating output from Al models - carried out by MLCommons, an open engineering consortium.

There has been speculation over whether Nvidia's dominant position in Al chips would weaken as the focus shifts from training Al models to inference. The company has pushed back hard against that, noting inference makes up around 40% of its data-center revenue and is growing fast. It says that its NVL72 server system delivers a fourfold improvement in Al model training but up to a 30 times improvement in inference compared with previous systems.

The tariffs target hardware and software from big players like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, with rates as high as 15% on some components. The EU’s pushing it as a move to bolster local tech, but it feels like a direct shot at U.S. dominance.I know the narrative is that these companies are “too big to fail” and have global supply chains to cushion the blow, but hear me out:

* Higher costs could squeeze margins, especially for hardware-heavy firms like Apple.
* If the EU doubles down (like they did with GDPR), could we see a broader tech trade war? China’s already hinted at “reciprocal measures.”
* Smaller tech ETFs (thinking XSD or SOXX) might take a bigger hit than the FAANG-heavy ones.

Yet, I’m seeing barely any chatter about this. Are we all too focused on AI hype or the Fed’s rate cuts to notice? Or is this just a blip that’ll fizzle out?

Is This the End of the Road for AMD or a New Era of Competition?,"seismic event just happened in the semiconductor world, and it has major implications for investors. NVIDIA and Intel announced a historic collaboration, with NVIDIA investing $5 billion in Intel and forming a joint venture to co-develop new chips for AI and personal computing.

This partnership is a big deal because it brings together two of the biggest players in the industry, which immediately sent shockwaves through the market. While Intel's stock saw a massive jump of up to 30%, competitors like AMD saw their shares drop by over 9% in initial trading.

Analysts are now debating the long-term impact on the competitive landscape.

1) For AMD: The concern is that the new partnership could create a powerful, integrated offering that directly challenges AMD's products in both the data center and consumer markets. This move may put pressure on AMD to accelerate its own product launches and strategies.

2) For the Alliance: The deal could be seen as a way for Intel to get a much-needed lifeline and a direct path into the AI space, while NVIDIA gains a massive partner to expand its ecosystem.

1j3c2eg,2025-03-04 15:32:08,Reddit,investing,NVDA,"Why Nvidia is Down, the DeepSeek Saga Ends with ChatGPT4.5’s Unveiling Confirming Worst Fears","I think one reason no one is talking about which caused for Nvidia to go down is the continuation of fears that Deepseek caused, but the further confirmation of those fears with OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT4.5, which was a major letdown due to it being so expensive and not even SoTA or top of the benchmarks like everyone hoped for to show the proof that the models are still scaling.

This ChatGPT4.5 moment marks the end of the era of AI scaling purely from pre-training compute and therefore cast doubt on the entire projected trajectory of AI making massive leaps in increasing intelligence and there for real meaningful applications with AI, which Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also mentioned which was that AI currently has no real meaningful applications.

Based on this, I think this raises a fundamental concern on the sustainability of the AI growth trend and brings out a potential of a much broader weakening for the AI related companies and tech sector. Which would spell a larger looming crisis if the rest of the market cannot uphold the overall economy without the AI story in the backdrop which has been the single dominant narrative and crutch for an overall weakening economy.",147

1hv5dc3,2025-01-06 19:04:38,Reddit,investing,"NVDA, TSLA",Tesla's Deliveries Disappoint: Time To Take Profits (Rating Downgrade),"**Summary**

* Tesla's stock remains overvalued despite disappointing vehicle delivery numbers and slowing growth.
* The surge in Tesla's stock price is driven by enthusiasm for AI advancements, Elon Musk's charisma, and Donald Trump's election victory rather than improvements in the company's core business fundamentals.
* At 126 times projected earnings, Tesla’s valuation is far higher than both industry peers and even Nvidia, making it increasingly difficult to justify its current price.
* The company's challenges, including declining deliveries, suggest that much of its upside potential has already been priced in.
* Investors should consider taking profits while the stock is trading at near-record highs.

Tesla’s stock has been riding a wave of unprecedented enthusiasm, with its price reaching all-time highs despite recently published delivery numbers that fell short of analysts' expectations. This discrepancy highlights a growing disconnect between Tesla’s market valuation and its actual performance. The company, once known for its relentless growth and innovation, delivered fewer cars in 2024 than in 2023, marking its first-ever year of declining deliveries. Despite this, Tesla’s stock price has surged by 63% in 2024, demonstrating how much investor sentiment rather than fundamental growth is driving its valuation.

In my October analysis, I discussed how Tesla’s slowing delivery growth and declining net income, despite aggressive price cuts, were becoming evident concerns. Even the highly anticipated robotaxi event failed to deliver the excitement that investors had hoped for, leading to a drop in the stock price at the time. While Tesla was already trading at a premium then, its valuation has only become more stretched in the months since.

The most recent data on Tesla’s deliveries reveals troubling trends. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company delivered 495,570 vehicles, falling short of the 512,300 deliveries expected by analysts. This shortfall contributed to a total of 1.79 million vehicles delivered for the year, a slight decline from the 1.81 million delivered in 2023. While the drop in deliveries may seem modest, it is significant as it breaks Tesla’s streak of consistent year-over-year growth, which had previously been a hallmark of its success. This is especially notable given the company’s reliance on vehicle sales for approximately 80% of its revenue. Without sustained growth in this area, the rationale for holding Tesla as a growth stock diminishes considerably.

From 2020 to 2023, Tesla experienced remarkable growth in deliveries, with annual numbers climbing steadily. However, 2024 marked a departure from this trend, with sales stagnating and then declining. Quarterly delivery figures also highlight the slowdown, with growth peaking in the second quarter of 2023 and subsequently stalling. This lack of growth is especially concerning for a company that reinvests all earnings into future expansion rather than paying dividends to shareholders. Tesla’s business model hinges on its ability to grow continuously, and the absence of that growth undermines its investment appeal.

Despite these challenges, Tesla’s stock has soared, buoyed by investor excitement over its advancements in artificial intelligence, Elon Musk’s magnetic persona, and the political implications of Donald Trump’s recent election victory. Musk has repeatedly emphasized Tesla’s position as a leader in AI and robotics, which has further fueled optimism among investors. Additionally, Tesla’s stock experienced significant gains following the November election, with investors speculating that Trump’s administration might ease regulations related to self-driving technology. However, such regulatory changes would only be beneficial if Tesla achieves full autonomy, an ambitious milestone that remains elusive.

Tesla’s valuation underscores the risks of the current enthusiasm. The stock is now trading at an extraordinary 126 times projected earnings, a multiple that far exceeds even AI powerhouse Nvidia, which trades at around 42 times earnings. Comparisons with legacy automakers further highlight the disparity. Tesla’s market cap of $1.2 trillion is greater than that of the next 20 largest automakers combined, yet it delivered fewer vehicles in 2024 than in 2023. This disconnect raises questions about whether Tesla’s valuation can be justified in the absence of tangible growth.

Tesla’s performance relative to Nvidia provides another perspective on the stock’s overvaluation. While both companies have benefited from their association with AI, Tesla’s stock has outperformed Nvidia’s despite facing significant headwinds in its core business. This suggests that investor enthusiasm for Tesla may be outpacing its actual achievements.

Although Tesla remains a leader in EV production and is recognized for its innovative technologies, including AI and robotics, these factors are already priced into the stock. The company’s market leadership positions it well to benefit from long-term trends in EV adoption, but its challenges in the short term, including declining deliveries and uncertain profitability from new ventures, make its current valuation appear precarious.

In conclusion, Tesla’s stock is trading at unsustainable levels given its recent performance. While the company’s technological advancements and market leadership are undeniable, its reliance on investor sentiment rather than business fundamentals makes it a risky investment at these prices. Taking profits now would allow investors to capitalize on the stock’s near-record highs while avoiding potential losses should the market reassess Tesla’s valuation. While the enthusiasm surrounding Tesla may persist in the short term, prudence suggests that this is an opportune moment to exit the position.

1gy2mfa,2024-11-23 16:50:13,Reddit,investing,NVDA,Isn't rebalancing selling your winners and keeping your losers?,"I've been thinking about the philosophy of rebalancing. The purpose of rebalancing your portfolio (just buy all stocks bro, excluded) is to maintain a risk profile that's consistent with your goals. 

So say if NVDA went up by 300% and INTC got halved and now NVDA is 80% of your portfolio. The philosophy of rebalancing would demand you to sell a large portion of NVDA and invest in INTC. 

That strategy if we look at the chart, doesn't work so well for your wallet. 

So here's me wondering if rebalancing on the surface is ""buy low sell high"" when in reality it's just ""sell your winners and buy more losers"". 

On the converse with an outsized NVDA position you just increased your risk on one company big time so if NVDA gets hit by say an antitrust or Jensen's brain scan AI go Skynet, you're gonna get decimated.

1ibb4qa,2025-01-27 16:04:45,Reddit,investing,NVDA,Jevon's Paradox explains why DeepSeek's breakthrough should increase Nvidia and TSMC demand,">Jevons’ Paradox occurs when technological improvements or efficiency gains in resource use lead to an overall increase in resource consumption, rather than a decrease.

>**Initial Expectation**: Efficiency improvements (e.g., using less fuel per kilometer with more efficient cars) should reduce the consumption of the resource (fuel).

>**What Actually Happens**: Increased efficiency lowers the cost of using the resource, making it more accessible and attractive. This, in turn, can increase demand for the resource, potentially leading to greater overall consumption.

TSMC and Nvidia should be going up - not down - because of Deepseek. DeepSeek made OpenAI-level models cheap. Consumption will go drastically up. When consumption goes up, more Nvidia and TSMC chips will be purchased to power them.

Better models do not hurt Nvidia and TSMC. They help. TSMC and Nvidia don't care who is making the best models, as long as they make it on their hardware. I would sell TSMC/Nvidia if Deepseek trained their models on Chinese-made chips. But they trained them on 10k+ Nvidia GPUs made by TSMC.

Further more, it makes companies like OpenAI and Anthropic try even harder to build moat, which means going all in on data centers.

Finally, DeepSeek's own paper says to move to the next step, you need more compute power:

>Therefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in this paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, **advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning.**",99

In contrast, the S&P 500 fell 1.6% to 5,861.57, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.8% to 18,544.42. 

These declines followed President Trump's announcement of new tariffs: 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, and an increase to 20% on Chinese products, set to take effect in March and April.

Beneath the surface, cracks are forming. The recent market downturn is attributed to fading AI hype, persistent inflation, and looming economic uncertainty. Notably, Nvidia shares plunged 8.5% despite reporting better-than-expected earnings, signaling waning enthusiasm in the tech sector.

Adding to the concern, the CNN Fear & Greed Index has plummeted to 21, indicating ""extreme fear"" among investors. Historically, such levels of fear have been associated with market bottoms, suggesting a potential for a rebound.

Given these mixed signals, I foresee a potential correction dragging the Dow down to the 42,160 area. Overheated valuations, rising geopolitical risks, and exhausted bullish momentum could trigger a major pullback.

Since I've posted these, the stock has bubbled up \~200%. I am doubling down.

In my final DD for this stock, I will explain how national security concerns present another roadblock for QUBT investors (you really should've quit this stock by now though).

# The China Connection

[The China Connection](https://preview.redd.it/itzzdx3hql9e1.jpg?width=185&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f9c12eabe1a3d9c95054eced0674e6b49f2330e)

Quantum computing is a key US national security priority because of its applications to encryption, communications, and logistics. QUBT is clearly trying to pitch itself into US government procurement roles, most notably their [5th NASA contract](https://www.inflation.us/content/peak-stupidity-qubt-worth-26b-26000-nasa-contract) (better described as a proof of concept agreement) for $26,000 which you can read [here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/quantum-computing-inc-awarded-contract-by-nasa-to-support-phase-unwrapping-using-dirac-3-photonic-optimization-solver-302333581.html).

**Senior QUBT are foreign nationals that will struggle to get security clearances**

As detailed in my previous posts, QUBT has very few technical staff, and of those, the majority are foreign nationals. To work on major government contracts, these QUBT staff members will need to gain security clearances, which will include questioning on foreign citizenship, ties and contacts with other nations, length of habitation in the US and so on. Gaining top level security clearances (which high value quantum computing use cases will require) will be especially hard if they are from countries that the United States is not allied with. See below:

* Yuping Huang - Chief Quantum Officer (China)
* Yong Meng Sua - Chief Technical Officer (Malaysia)
* Guangju Zhang - Senior optical engineer (China)
* Yichen Ma - Quantum Nanophotonics engineer (China)
* He Zhang - Quantum Tech Lead (China)
* Lac Nguyen - Quantum Tech Lead (Vietnam)
* Milan Begliarbekov - Foundry Director (likely former USSR)
* There are about 5 more of Chinese descent (but I can't view their background through Linkedin), as well as another 4 of Indian birth (but Elon said that was OK)

Now whether you like it or not, their backgrounds, particularly in Trump's America, will impede their ability to gain key government contracts in ways that don't apply to Google, Rigetti or IonQ.

Are they spies or foreign assets? I don't know, but it's the **risk profile** and **perception that matters** for a clearance, not whether they've actually committed any wrongdoing.

# Could they actually be linked to hostile governments?

Potentially yes. 

**Background**

In the past 15 years, [China](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/us-china-tech-quantum/) is increasingly investing in quantum computing related espionage.  And as the private sector becomes more difficult for Chinese intelligence to operate in with impunity,[ college campuses ](https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/china-focuses-espionage-on-u-s-colleges-and-universities)have become a more attractive avenue for obtaining critical U.S. secrets.

As detailed in my previous posts, almost all the quantum computing specialists at QUBT either currently work or formerly worked/studied at the otherwise unremarkable Steven's Institute of Technology in Heboken, New Jersey.

**Stevens Institute and Chinese Money**

Between 1st July 2012 and 30 June 2015 ([see February 2024 data](https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/topics/section-117-foreign-gift-and-contract-reporting/section-117-foreign-gift-and-contract-data) \- snippet below) , the Stevens Institute operated a $500 000 dollar contract funded from an undisclosed **Chinese** source with receipt date on the 30th of June 2013. Similarly, for the same exact contract and receipt dates, they received another $500 000 dollar contract from an undisclosed Malaysian source, as well as another $300 000 contract from an undisclosed Dominican Republic source. Unlike other gifts and contracts that are listed on government records for Stevens, I am unable to find any other public sources starting what these funds were used for or where they were from.

Interestingly, if these contracts were from the same source, splitting it across three sources and over three years would allow them to go under the $250 000 annual threshold that requires mandatory reporting to the US Government under [Section 117 of the Higher Education Act](https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/topics/section-117-foreign-gift-and-contract-reporting), and hence avoid triggering greater government scrutiny.

**Stevens Institute and Chinese Collaboration**

Bucking the trend of American universities ending collaboration with Chinese institutions, the Stevens Institute has increased them. This includes a recent agreements with the [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/china-focuses-espionage-on-u-s-colleges-and-universities), [Zijing education](https://www.stevens.edu/zijing-partnership), [Beacon University](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/beacon-education-announces-partnership-with-stevens-institute-of-technology-301887815.html).

Furthermore, in 2019, [the Stevens institute](https://thestute.com/2019/11/08/chinese-offered-as-a-foreign-language-for-the-first-time-at-stevens-next-semester/) added Chinese language classes to its offering for the first time and the university currently ranks [12th ](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/universities-highest-percentage-international-students)out of all American universities for share of foreign students.

Now of course this isn't evidence of any wrongdoing, but Chinese authorities [keep a close watch](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/05/china-overseas-students-face-harassment-and-surveillance-in-campaign-of-transnational-repression/) on its students in the US, which gives it a large pool of potential assets to target.

# Yuping Huang

This name just keeps coming up over and over again. He's a professor at the Stevens Institute, he's on the board of QUBT, he's their chief quantum officer, he's developed almost all of their patents, he works on photonics, computing, chip design, this whole company depends on **YUPING HUANG**.

So I tell myself I've got to understand this guy, otherwise I'm never going to understand this company. That begins with looking at his publication record, which ultimately underpins the value of the company's patents, and hence the company's commercial viability.

**Yuping Huangs publication record**

Citation Farming is the practice of artificially boosting the number of citations to certain research papers or studies to create an inflated sense of their importance or credibility. In the context of industrial espionage, generating a network of heavily cross-referenced or fabricated studies, espionage actors can create a false research landscape that directs competitors toward unproductive efforts, establishes fake reputations for gaining insider access, or serves as a cover for extracting sensitive information under the guise of legitimate collaboration.

Below I have generated a table of the top papers that Yuping Huang has led authorship over the past 12 years (as well as two papers where Yong Meng Sua was the lead author -  with Yuping Huang as coauthor). These papers, which on face value have a modest number of citations, suddenly looks much less impressive when you look at where the citations come from. A major source of Huang's citation come from either himself (which is counted here) and researchers from Stevens/QUBT (some of which are not counted here, so I'm actually undercounting the issue here!). The second major source of citations come from Chinese researchers, some of which are okay, but also many that do not come with significant publishing profiles.

This is important because their research underpins QUBT's patents, and hence their chances of actually making any breakthroughs. It's clear that much of their publishing background occurs in an echo chamber inside the Stevens institute, where researchers are able to cite one another repeatedly and juice up their citation counts. Additionally there is the second element that a suspiciously large number of their citations come from Chinese researchers.

So I see two possibilities. One is that their quantum technology is junk that has been developed in an echo chamber and hence has no value. Or two, their quantum technology is junk AND some of their employees are Chinese assets.

Is the top of this Pyramid Nvidia? 

Nvidia invests in companies like CoreWeave and Recursion Pharmaceuticals, and these companies in turn, buy chips from Nvidia for their operations. Nvidia has also partnered with and invested in other companies like Intel and OpenAI, and is a major chip supplier for companies like Microsoft and Meta. 

Nvidia has agreed to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, and in return, OpenAI is buying Nvidia systems for its data centers.

Nvidia has invested $5 billion in Intel and is partnering with it to develop new chips. Intel also buys Nvidia chips for some of its own products and services

Nvidia's $6.3 billion deal with AI data center firm CoreWeave (CRWV), a customer of the chipmaker in which it holds a 7% equity stake. There's Nvidia's reported $2 billion investment linked to its customer xAI (XAAI.PVT).

**It's Time To Call Bullshit - Quantum**

 

TLDR: While I am super excited for what Quantum Computers could do for society in the distant future, it is probably a bad investment right now... the bubble will pop.

**NVDA CEO says the tech is decades away:** [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-ceo-says-useful-quantum-164500814.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-ceo-says-useful-quantum-164500814.html)

Well he wrote this book a year ago, before people knew wtf quantum was... and basically got the readers hyped about quantum but says like 100 times in the book that we won't see this stuff happen until 2050. Maybe a decade away for some things in the pharma industry. Very refreshing to get a non-Wall Street person talking about the space, and frankly, he probably knows best given he's a worldly known Physicist. I read this over the holidays, it was a great read fyi (not an ad, just saying).

 

**Short Quantum thesis by Martin Shkreli:** [https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1876950624824177127](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1876950624824177127) Think what you want of the pharma bro, but he wrote an excellent piece on why he is short quantum. TLDR: the best quantum companies are GOOG and IBM. Both are too large to see any financial impact from quantum on the stock. However, these two stocks have the balance sheet to support massive/costly R&D in quantum that these smaller ""quantum"" companies don't have. He makes the interesting point that these companies went public (IONQ, Rigetti, D Wave, etc) because they are running out of money and need to raise money and dilute shareholders to stay afloat. IF they were that good, they would have been scooped up by IBM and GOOG already. He also notes the best quantum companies (outside of GOOG and IBM) are still private, so average people like you and I can't invest in them anyways. Basically the shitty quantum companies are the ones that are public right now.

 

**And most importantly, the computers don't work well. IONQ and RGTI computers are actually down right now.** [https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879607624569872443](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879607624569872443) & [https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879896705434591582](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879896705434591582)

These computers aren't even online right now for IONQ and RGTI.

 

Basically this all seems like an emotional yolo into quantum. Most people don't understand it and the commerical applications are years and years, probably decades away. I would invest with caution as this has bubble written all over it , imo. Yes, I am short right now. ",79

""we explore how extreme parallel computing is reshaping the tech landscape, the performance of the major semiconductor players, the competition Nvidia faces, the depth of its moat, and how its software stack cements its leadership. We will also address a recent development from CES — the arrival of so-called “AI PCs” — with data from Enterprise Technology Research.

The tl;dr is there is huge growth ahead in AI and Nvidia is not the only player who will benefit.

Keeping it simple: I have 800 shares currently worth $100,000. But that's 50% of my individual stocks portfolio.

For me, this is significant as I don't come from wealth.

I'm 35 and have a growing family. This also happens to be a good year for me to make some gains with stocks because I'm taking a lot of time off from work this year for family bonding and will likely fall into a lower tax bracket. I still have to speak with my CPA about this.

After selling some of these shares, I plan to purchase more index funds that track with the S&P 500. I feel more comfortable with this move, even if it means losing out on further NVDA gains in 10-20+ years. I have a feeling there will be some pullback on the stock and AI in the shortterm.

That said, I'd like to keep a portion of the NVDA shares for the long term but I'm wondering how much.

Thoughts?

(besides buy more, haha)

This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. *(I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.)*

I did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general. 

**Investment strategy:**

1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. *(roughly $400 a month)*  
2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. *(this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.)*  
3. keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. *(Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.)*  
4. diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. *(less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.)*

I think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future.

**Looking forward:**

Since Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies. So I'll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome!

My next goal will be to reach $300,000 invested by the end of 2026. What do you all think? Achievable?",78

Nvidia’s stock has been climbing without much pullback, while AMD has experienced slightly the opposite. Which one do you think is the better overall investment right now?  (I’m aware NVDA currently has 90% of the market share)

AMD (AMD) $162, 5% lower after a decent beat and guidance and upgrades from analysts.

**Looks like a classic sell on news after a meteoric 100% rise this year.**

**Overall, I had trimmed 30% of my position on Friday, and don’t plan to buy that back. Planning to hold on to the rest.**

1. AMD Q2 revenue of $7.685B, up 32% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter,  $270M beat over $7.415B estimates.
2. Better guidance for Q3 of $8.7B, up 13% quarter-over-quarter and up 28% year-over-year V consensus of  $8.323B. Mostly on data center growth from M1355 ramp up.
3. This does not include projected $1.5B of lost China revenue, which is still awaiting approval.
4. Market share gains over Intel in CPUS from EPYC server chips, and Ryzen client chips.
5. Gaming Radeon GPUs would have been better if not for supply constraints.
6. The weaker segments, embedded is finally turning around, while gaming will remain flat in Q3
7. Weak margins remain a key concern though, which has always been AMD’s weakness and reason for the poorer multiple and lower valuation.
8. There is widespread expectation that AMD would be able to raise AI GPU prices, which are still substantially cheaper than Nvidia’s Blackwell’s but there was no explicit confirmation during the earnings call - perhaps a reason for the drop,
9. Benchmark reiterated its Buy rating on AMD PT $210 from $170. KeyBanc maintained its Sector Weight rating on AMD. Oppenheimer kept its Perform rating on AMD's stock.Meanwhile, Mizuho raised the price target on AMD's stock to $183 from $175.

I'll start:

 * MU - It's been battered in recent weeks, but I think it's a good buy here and have been adding to my holdings. They make VRAM for Nvidia among other things.
 * RXRX - They do AI drug discovery. Nvidia invested $50M in RXRX recently.

But if you look at the expenses, they are much more than the revenue they are generating. I understand it is a growth company, but I am not sure of the complete technology. So, I am trying to get some insights and want to check if you guys are aware or have any idea what they are talking about. Similarly, I noticed RGTI, QUBT, and QBTS are all going up.

I understand NVDA has gone through the same cycle at one point, but as Jensen mentioned, he was just lucky that AI happened and GPUs were useful. I am not sure if Quantum is anywhere near. It takes more than 3 years as IONQ has presented to commercialize, and I'm not sure if there is an actual application that can leverage the technology fully.

Thanks for your valuable feedback.

Updated: IonQ reported a net loss of $177.5 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $36.5 million.

With all the acquisitions and compensation to more leadership teams, losses are expected to increase to $ 250 million per quarter.

To acquire Oxford Ionic, IONQ paid $1.065 billion in IONQ common stock and $10 million in cash. So, basically, the stockholders have already been diluted.

Seagate (STX) and Western Digital (WDC) for traditional HDDs and SSDs.

Micron (MU) and Samsung for flash storage (NAND SSDs).

NVIDIA (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) for GPUs and CPUs powering AI workloads.  Nvidia obviously gets all the attention right now.

Arista Networks (ANET) and Broadcom (AVGO) for network hardware.

Supermicro (SMCI) for custom-built servers.

AI isn't slowing down anytime soon, so it seems like investing in these storage and infrastructure suppliers will be a good investment for a long time.

For example in the Dot com bubble in addition to tech stocks you had the collapse of Enron and MCI Worldcom. 

In 2008 in addition to bank stocks you had insurance such as AIG, big three automakers, General Electric etc.

2020 you had a lot of retailers that had been struggling for years file for bankruptcy.

Here are my predictions of who/what will be impacted:

*  Crypto - Too many meme coins and speculation. There will be a massive correction due soon not sure if as severe as 2022 but its coming
* Office Space REITS- some of these have recovered but I don't see their finances improving anytime soon as return to office has been very gradual. Also recent federal cuts will hurt demand especially in suburban office space markets.
* Meme Stocks in particular Tesla and Game stop. Telsa's PE ratio is way too high and Musk's recent antics have hurt future sales prospects. Gamestop also has way too high of a PE ratio. In a downturn people will turn away and its price will collapse
* Broadcast /Cable companies - These companies are struggling with cord cutting. In a downturn this will be first thing many consumers cut. Comcast is very vulnerable. Also any regional sports stocks such as MSGE will get hit. 
* Almost every remaining regional retailer that is publicly traded. I'm not sure how many of these are honestly left but any non national retailer that does not have a decent web presence will have a decent chance of not surviving next downturn. 
* AI related stocks. Companies have been spending hundreds of billions for their AI buildout. There will be cuts to AI budgets that not only impact NVDA and AI oriented stocks, but any REITs that own data centers, power companies doing build outs 
* Oil and Gas companies. US production has increase significantly even after blip during pandemic. Due to higher drilling costs in the US expect any dip in oil price to wipe out a lot of producers especially if they are too leveraged in debt. ",59

Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024.

**Lessons Learned:**

\- **Compounding Takes Time but Works:** I’ve started noticing compounding effects really kick in. Some months, my portfolio’s growth outpaced my monthly salary, which is both surreal and inspiring.

\- **Volatility is Real:** Watching significant swings in my portfolio value is tough. To manage this, I’ve adopted a ""set it and forget it"" mindset and avoid checking my account daily.

**- Stay Consistent:** It’s easy to get caught up in market trends and daily life, but staying consistent with contributions has been the most rewarding strategy.

**Why I’m Sharing:**

I hope to inspire others who might be hesitant about investing. I realize $1,000 isn't possible for everyone - I'm extremely lucky to be able to do this - but I think starting with even $50 a week or a month can be impactful. Financial independence is achievable with consistency, discipline, and patience. 

For transparency, I focus solely on my brokerage account in these posts, even though I also fully fund my Roth IRA, 403(b), and my wife’s self-directed 401(k). We also maintain a hands-off Acorns account with about $60,000. I’ve thought about moving that money to Fidelity but appreciate the safety and simplicity it offers.

**Looking Ahead:**

Starting in January, I plan to post each week to give a closer look at my journey. I’ll share more details on my strategy and lessons as they unfold.

If you have questions about my approach, portfolio, or anything else, feel free to ask! Thanks for following along, and good luck on your own investing journeys!",54

1lc6y0t,2025-06-15 20:12:09,Reddit,investing,NVDA,IonQ shares may plummet tomorrow,"Full disclosure: I have 6/20 puts at a 39 strike.

I’ve been following this massive insider sale story very closely since I first learned about the CEO filing his Rule 105b5-1 (intent to sell) of a vast majority of his shares. 

Background on IonQ, it’s a highly speculative quantum computing company that has nearly doubled in the last 90 days after its new CEO de Masi stepped in. De Masi has spent the last 90 days going on Bloomberg and CNBC advertising the impending breakthroughs in Quantum and the future value of his company being the next NVIDIA. He must be really excited about the long-term growth of this company and be heavily vested in its future success right? WRONG.

Him and his other executives/directors just sold a MASSIVE amount of their shares on Friday after hours. Like actually sold. Not just filing a form with the SEC with the “intent to sell. They filed Form 4s which are official sales. They collectively dumped $113M. With the CEO selling 80% of his shares. Many other executives with significant sales, some directors nearly completely cashing out. 

Ok so why is this a problem? Shouldn’t they be able to get paid? Yes and no. It’s not entirely uncommon for a CEO of a company to offload shares. Sometimes those volumes can be big. But if you’re the CEO of a $10B purely speculative tech company that is currently losing hundreds of millions a year with no foreseeable path to profitability, your ownership is key to investors conviction. If you aren’t aligned, how are we supposed to have faith in a long-term story.

He sold $103M, shouldn’t he be allowed to get rich? He’s got new incentive shares available if he hits milestones? He’s already rich…. he had tens of millions before cashing out. He’s not hurting in the lifestyle department. If he really thought this was the next NVIDIA as he said, his $103M could be worth billions in the future. If you already have more money than you’d ever spend, why the hell would you sell out? Because he’s calling the top, at least for now. He pumped the fuck out of the share price in his 90 days, and he knows this is the top. 

There is no good reason a company this unprofitable with tech that could be anyways from 5-20 years from being practical should be priced the way it is. Maybe there’s long term upside. If IonQ wins the quantum race. But right now it’s anyone’s game. Nothing is going to happen soon.

He already won, he cashed out at recent highs. As far as I’m concerned his future incentive based shares are meaningless because whether this works or fails he just got paid $103M for 90 days of work is cashed it. If IonQ goes to zero, he still has enough more to become a billionaire investing in the markets by the time he’s 80.

Alignment is broken. If people really consider the weight of this, they will dump. But it is so hard to rationalize with IonQ bulls because they are the epitome of moonshot speculators. They will do anything to justify a gross overvaluation for a purely speculative stock bc they all think this is “their money ticket”. It’s not, certainly not right now. De Masi knows more than us about where this company is going in the short/medium term and he just said he doesn’t want his money along for the ride. 

If you are long IonQ, you’ve got a ton of volatility headed your way and a CEO who doesn’t want his money on the table. If you’re a regard like me, there is huge opportunity in puts if morons stop artificially inflating the price.

This company should be priced for what it is, speculation. $1B market cap not $10B. $5 share price not $40-50. 

I may or may not win my bet, but holy shit this is shaping up to be one of the biggest pump and dumps I’ve seen of a speculative tech company in my life.

1hvypmd,2025-01-07 19:49:51,Reddit,investing,NVDA,The outlook for ASML & the lithography industry,"ASML just had its investor day, and the big takeaway was that they stuck to their long-term revenue forecast. That definitely calmed some nerves after the recent 2025 downgrade and a pretty lackluster year for orders.

But if you dig a little deeper, there are some interesting shifts happening in the semiconductor world, especially with AI shaking things up. One standout is memory—because datacenter GPUs rely so heavily on volatile memory, ASML seriously bumped up its growth forecast for DRAM wafer volumes over the next six years. On the flip side, NAND wafer growth took a pretty big hit:

https://preview.redd.it/879zmvu1ilbe1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb72ad6bb45052ab9028a48f22bf0eebcc38db69

A bunch of this growth is still gonna happen in the cloud, with AI training and inference servers pumping up the datacenter semis market and keeping that sweet CAGR looking good.

https://preview.redd.it/kcyqaikbilbe1.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc621546147cec2050d89625b5bce03b3e47eda4

As AI servers are both DDR and HBM intensive, this drives the strongly expected growth in the number of DRAM wafers mentioned above:

https://preview.redd.it/kxz7zmqfilbe1.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=73b94ea2e9690ba2ddfe3a70bb5c3174efccb5b0

# ASML’s High-NA Outlook

ASML’s take on high-NA is basically, “We’re good to go—the tools are ready, we’re ready, and the ecosystem’s ready.” The only catch? Because the optics are bigger, these tools use a half-field exposure. In plain English, that means each shot only prints half the circuit design compared to older EUV systems, which isn’t great for productivity. But ASML says they’ve tackled this by speeding up how quickly the tool moves between fields.

Looking at the numbers, high-NA can crank out 175 wafers per hour (WPH), which is pretty solid, especially when you compare it to the latest version of regular EUV running at 220 WPH.

https://preview.redd.it/hjhkqgrp6mbe1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=467cc6c3d6172df2576d7851ea9f87c8b0ef3824

Bottom line—high-NA’s productivity is already impressive and even better than the older EUV systems ASML has out there. Plus, there’s a clear plan to make these tools even faster. Honestly, it’s wild to think about how chaotic EUV was a decade ago, with everyone freaking out about whether it would ever actually catch on.

# EUV just keeps leveling up

ASML had a tough time getting EUV off the ground at first—early tools couldn’t hit decent source power, and productivity kind of sucked. But since then, they’ve been on a mission to crank up source power and, in turn, boost productivity.

**Here’s the deal:** more source power means wafers get exposed faster, so the tools can churn through more wafers per hour. And more wafers per hour? That’s good news for everyone. ASML gets to slap higher price tags on its tools and rake in better margins, while customers lower their cost per wafer by cranking out more in less time.

https://preview.redd.it/qr388t047mbe1.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f6f7a585a1ae641ac1b6502cf8829dc0314bbdb

And this isn’t the end of the story. ASML’s already got a solid roadmap to keep pushing productivity even higher for both its low-NA and high-NA tools, so there’s plenty more to come.

# ASML’s 2030 Game Plan

ASML isn’t just about building cutting-edge litho tools—they’re also pros at mapping out long-term financial goals. Here’s how they do it: they take a guess at how many wafers will be pumped out at each node by 2030, then work backward to figure out how many exposures those wafers will need using their tools. They factor in everything—EUV, immersion, basic DUV, KrF, i-line, and metrology.

Next, they estimate how productive each tool will be, which helps them figure out how many tools need to be in the market and how many more they’ll need to sell. On top of that, they throw in around EUR 12 billion a year in revenue just for servicing all the tools already out there.

When you crunch the numbers, it adds up to somewhere between EUR 44 and 60 billion in revenue by 2030. And if you look at ASML’s track record, they’ve always hit or even beaten their targets. To make a solid return on this stock, we probably need to see them hit at least EUR 50 billion in revenue.

https://preview.redd.it/ju29xczm7mbe1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=21d0fc95ad1b6bcfada4949443545473b050fe87

As for margins, the guidance isn’t crazy aggressive. Honestly, the only reason the advanced semi industry is still scaling at all is because of ASML. Yet, weirdly enough, their margins are still lower than a lot of other big players in silicon. Go figure.

https://preview.redd.it/1bgzjxqp7mbe1.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c3f525119e7a75c74e04ffa9e2ac278fdbced1

# The Bull Case for ASML

**Let’s be real—ASML has basically been selling its tools at a discount.** It’s hands-down the most dominant player in the entire semiconductor game, with zero competition. Compare that to TSMC, which still has to keep an eye on Samsung, Intel, and maybe even Rapidus in advanced chipmaking. ARM has to watch out for RISC-V, Cadence and Synopsys are still duking it out, Nvidia’s losing some datacenter accelerator share to Broadcom and Marvell, and Analog Devices has to compete with Texas Instruments and Microchip in analog semis.

Don’t get me wrong—these companies are all in strong positions with solid growth prospects. But when it comes to a **true monopoly?** ASML is in a league of its own.

Now check this out—TSMC has consistently outperformed ASML when it comes to gross margins. And honestly, it’s mostly the American companies that know how to squeeze every dollar out of a dominant position. ASML could’ve been pulling in 60–65% gross margins like Nvidia has done in the past if they wanted to, but they’ve been way too nice about pricing. Let’s face it—this isn’t a business that should be settling for 50% gross margins.

https://preview.redd.it/ryfd39x68mbe1.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed50e3ab62a6f1b4a2e77857294e9e92228741b6

# Conclusion

ASML is basically a bet on keeping Moore’s Law alive and pushing the scaling roadmap forward. Right now, the risk-reward balance still looks pretty good—mainly because TSMC and Intel are both making solid progress and have a clear game plan for the Angstrom era. Plus, their top-tier customers in high-performance computing are more than willing to shell out big bucks for the performance boosts these Angstrom chips deliver.

Looking at the current valuation, it’s actually pretty fair for what ASML’s got going on. Investors are basically paying the same kind of multiple they did six years ago—back when the outlook was just as strong as it is now and the stock absolutely skyrocketed.

Don’t be surprised if Trump wakes up tomorrow, sees the market green, and thinks: “Guess I didn’t scare them enough.”

No one really reacted to his half-denial about removing tariffs on chips, semiconductors, and computers which, let’s be honest, sounded more like confusion than policy. If anything, it only made things murkier. And when Trump gets ignored, what does he usually do? Doubles down. More tariffs? Wouldn’t be shocking.

Meanwhile, China just pulled the plug on rare earth exports. You know, the critical materials needed to make every chip, missile, EV, and iPhone. Trump tried to get Ukraine to help supply these metals last year. It didn’t work. And China knows exactly how vital this is to U.S. tech dominance.

All major tech players from NVIDIA to Apple rely on these resources. So yes, while the market is green for now, don’t mistake silence for safety. This might be the setup — not the relief.

Bulls are walking into a trap with smiles on their faces.
I hope some of you at least get out with a profit before the hammer drops.

China got a big monopoly on rare earth, they got 70% of the world reserve, and some exist only in China. Moreover, the piece of the process (refining) is under control of China at 90% of rare metal. Indeed, Western countries decided in 80's to abandon the sector and relocate it to China, because it's expensive and very polluting. So, China decide to develop this activity thank to their advantaged place. Everyone was happy because that was cheap and the western land were not polluted by this activity.

But, now, China is tired to see Western Countries spend some effort to ruin them. Today, they don't want to see US bulding the army with their own REE against them. The fact is US can't say ""we gonna f:ck China"" and ""ok we gonna make a deal"". China wants a real deal, that means the end of tech ban, and the end of offensive policy of US against them. In may/june, Trump was very kind after the deal, ""yes we fight China but friendly"". In the fact, US gov took some decision against Chine, pushing them to ban ree export : Nvidia H20 with killswitch to control their IT infrastructure, tax on chinese ship ... US didn't respect the deal and the process of negociating.

Trump threat with tariff. It's not ""no effect"", but China is a country with a mission. They live to be the first, not to get an iphone and 10000 followers on instagram or of. So they don't care about the rest if that save the interest of the state. Some companies lost millions every months cause of the ban, and CCP doesn't care ... 

Trump knows 100% of tariff on China is : laptop, tv, consummer hight tech with a double price. Are you ready to buy your Hp laptop for 2000 dollars instead 1000 dollars ?

But the big danger is REE. Today, US can't get them. They can but all the money they got to build fab and mines, it's impossible to meet the demand without chinese ree. In 2030, some REE demand will rise up to x6 cause of data center, defense, green energy and EV.

No REE = No data center, no Tesla, No Nvidia, no Apple, No amazon, no Microsoft ... Everything will stop.

They said it outperformed the H100 in “inference” — the execution of AI functions as opposed to the training of AI models — and would help produce autonomous weapons systems, intelligence surveillance platforms, and other military advancements. “We are fuelling the very infrastructure that will be used to modernise and expand the Chinese military,” they said in the letter, arranged by an advocacy group called Americans for Responsible Innovation.

1izy2ft,2025-02-28 04:09:32,Reddit,StockMarket,NVDA,Why did the market almost as a whole take a hit across the board at 4pm today?,"Looking at today’s trends, it’s pretty clear that around 4 PM EST, the market took a noticeable hit almost across the board. This wasn’t just an isolated sector or a single stock tanking—there was an obvious triggering event that caused a broad sell-off.

From what I can gather, there are a few likely culprits:

1. **Nvidia’s Earnings & AI Sector Pullback** – Nvidia reported earnings that initially looked solid, but their guidance on margins didn’t meet the market’s expectations. Given how much weight Nvidia carries in the AI-driven rally, a dip in NVDA caused ripple effects throughout tech and semiconductor stocks.
2. **Tariff Announcement & Trade War Concerns** – The White House announced new tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada. Markets don’t react well to protectionist policies, and this sparked concerns about retaliation and supply chain disruptions.
3. **End-of-Month Positioning & Liquidity Issues** – Since we’re closing out February, some institutions could be rebalancing portfolios, locking in gains, or reducing exposure ahead of upcoming economic data. This might have amplified the dip.

The S&P 500 dropped about 1.6%, Nasdaq took a harder hit at 2.8%, and the Dow slid around 0.4%. So while Nvidia’s earnings miss might have been the spark, the tariff announcement probably fueled the broader downturn.

That said, I’m curious if anyone else caught something I missed—was there another macro event, options expiration, or something else that compounded the move?",703

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‘Liberation Day’ events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn’t respond well and selling pressure intensified. 🔴

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China’s response.

""China played it wrong. They panicked, the one thing they can’t afford to do!""

Do you agree with JPMorgan? Are we heading toward a recession? How do you see China's reaction and Trump's comment? How was your week? Did you open any short positions or earn from bonds? I didn’t make any trades this week. What’s your prediction for next week?

Shares are dropping.,"Nvidia shares were under pressure ahead of Monday’s stock market open after China’s top regulatory authority said the U.S. chipmaker has violated the country’s antitrust rules.

The State Administration for Market Regulation announced that following a preliminary investigation, Nvidia was found to be in breach of those rules, with relation to its acquisition of Mellanox Technology Co., Ltd. with Restrictive Conditions.

“The State Administration for Market Regulation decided to conduct further investigation in accordance with the law,” the SAMR said in a brief statement

Shares of Nvidia were down more than 2% in premarket trade.

The world’s biggest company by market cap, Nvidia shares have gained 32% this year.

China’s anti-monopoly body said last December that it was opening an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, making reference to the chipmaker’s acquisition of Israeli networking technology group Mellanox. Nvidia announced the $6.9 billion deal in 2019, but it didn’t close until April 2020, after approval from authorities in China and elsewhere.

Bloomberg reported that Nvidia has indicated pressure by China regulators to keep supplying chips to local companies, in exchange for approving that deal. Nvidia announced this summer that the U.S. would allow the company to sell its H20 AI chips made specifically for China to comply with export controls to that nation after a U.S. ban in the spring.

Chinese officials have discouraged businesses from using its chips, amid claims they are a security risk, according to reports. While its latest results were deemed by some analysts to be lackluster, others have said investors are putting too much focus on its China business.

The report comes amid trade talks between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer with China’s China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng and top trade negotiator Li Chenggang in Madrid. Bessent said Monday that a deal to keep ByteDance’s TikTok running in the U.S. is getting close, though that could hinge on China trade concession demands.",506

I gathered information from Macrotrends, which has earnings report dating back to early 2009. For most cases that was sufficient: only Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet generated meaningful earnings before then, and it still made up a relatively small protion in nominal terms. (Sources: [Apple](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/net-income), [Microsoft](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/net-income), [Alphabet](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/net-income), [Meta](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/META/meta-platforms/net-income), [Amazon](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/net-income), [Nvidia](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/net-income), [Broadcom](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AVGO/broadcom/net-income), [Tesla](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/net-income))

A couple things to note:
- Since Nvidia and Broadcom have yet to report for the quarter, I estimated net income based on consensus EPS. This likely underestimates since they reliably beat estimates (especially Nvidia).
- I plotted all the companies on the same vertical scale so that we could directly compare differences in their earnings.
- At $34.4B (likely generous since it excludes much of the early period when Tesla was not profitable), Tesla has generated less cumulative net income than Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia did in the last two quarters alone. I knew about the first three, but not the latter three. Moreover, it less net income in its entire corporate lifespan than Apple did **in last quarter alone**, in what was generally viewed as a disappointing quarter for Apple.
- The lead with which Apple has over the rest of the field is remarkable, although the overall trend appears flat. But I didn't appreciate the very strong seasonal trend with each release cycle leading into the holiday season.
- Alphabet actually takes the lead for the last year, topping $100 billion in net income.
- I was surprised to learn that despite a late start, Meta has actually made more money cumulatively than Amazon.

Now tell me honestly… is this really a bull market?

Or is it mostly tech bull market where tech names like Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix and Google and Amazon too... 

Because if you remove these 7 tech names plus Costco too, the rest of the market looks like it’s been going sideways or even rolling over hard. This ain't a healthy, broad-based rally. It’s basically just a handful of mega caps doing all the heavy lifting while the rest of the market is lagging behind big time. 

There are other few more stocks that have done well such PLTR and WMT and HOOD and UBER that are much at their ATH... Feels like everyone’s celebrating all-time highs, but under the surface it's a different story.

Commercial real estate is screaming a crisis. Office delinquency rates just hit 11.7%, worse than 2008’s peak of 10.7%. Multifamily isn’t far behind at 6.9%. That means banks and credit markets are sitting on toxic exposure that can’t just be papered over. This isn’t a “low fuel” warning light; the tank is empty. The system is already running on fumes.

The auto sector faces its own cliff. Federal EV tax credits ($7,500 new, $4,000 used) expire September 30. Sales have been artificially front-loaded. July used EV sales hit nearly 37,000, a record. But that’s demand pulled forward, not organic growth. After September, the floor drops out. Automakers and suppliers will hit a wall in Q4 as incentives vanish.

And the supposed engine of the market, AI, is showing cracks. Nvidia’s growth slowed from +69% to +53% YoY, and an MIT study found 95% of AI projects fail to deliver results.

Every major AI company that reports earnings risks popping the bubble, and right now, institutions are most likely delaying the inevitable to save their positions and hand them off to dumb money before the music stops.

TLDR: From CRE delinquencies to the EV demand cliff to the overinflated AI trade, the market isn’t “fueling up for more upside.” It’s running on fumes. September through Q4 looks bearish, with downside risk in banks, autos, and megacap tech. Upside is gone, now it’s just a matter of when the fade accelerates.",397
1kqje6w,2025-05-19 20:36:41,Reddit,StockMarket,NVDA,Nvidia CEO: China chip ban 'deeply painful' as $15 billion in sales have been lost as a result,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-ceo-china-chip-ban-deeply-painful-as-15-billion-in-sales-have-been-lost-as-a-result-162124142.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-ceo-china-chip-ban-deeply-painful-as-15-billion-in-sales-have-been-lost-as-a-result-162124142.html)

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, at the Computex trade show in Taipei on Monday, said the Trump administration's ban on its H20 chips for China has cost the company $15 billion in sales.

During an interview with technology analyst Ben Thompson, Huang called the ban ""enormously costly"" and ""deeply painful."" He pointed to the $5.5 billion in charges the company expects to see in its first fiscal quarter due to the ban.

""No company in history has ever written off that much inventory,"" he said. ""\[N\]ot only am I losing $5.5 billion — we wrote off $5.5 billion — we walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably ... $3 billion worth of taxes.""

Wall Street analysts had projected that Nvidia could see anywhere between a $10 billion and $16 billion hit to revenue over the coming quarters from the most recent export ban on its H20 chips.

Nvidia has repeatedly updated its chips for the Chinese market in the past several years to comply with ever-tightening US trade restrictions, making the chips less and less powerful with each new iteration.

The latest ban on exports of its chips last month came just as the US government said it was investigating Nvidia over the use of its AI chips in China. It cited the release of a cheap AI model from Chinese startup DeepSeek powered by Nvidia's prior-generation H800s, which are currently banned from export to the country.

Huang implied Nvidia can't make another AI chip with its Hopper architecture for China under the current restrictions: ""\[T\]hat’s the limit of what we can do to Hopper, and we've cut it down to there's not much left to cut,"" he said. ""Anybody who thought that one chess move to somehow ban China from H20s would somehow cut off their ability to do AI is deeply uninformed.""

He added that the China AI market is worth $50 billion a year. ""China's doing fantastic, 50% of the world's AI researchers are Chinese and you're not going to hold them back, you're not going to stop them from advancing AI,"" he told Thompson, who published the interview in his newsletter, Stratechery.

Last week, the Financial Times and Reuters said Nvidia is looking to open a research and development center in China, which a person familiar with the matter confirmed in an email to Yahoo Finance.

Just as Nvidia's H20 chips were banned, Chinese tech giant Huawei was rushing to fill the gap. Huawei is reportedly set to ship chips more powerful than Nvidia's H100s.

Huang called Huawei ""formidable"" and ""a world-class technology company.""

Nvidia is set to report its first quarter earnings on May 28. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said in a note to investors Monday that Nvidia executives' post-earnings call with analysts ""could be contentious"" due to the recent H20 restrictions.

Trump's restrictive trade policies — his tariffs and AI chip export curbs to China — have sent Nvidia stock tumbling in recent months, just as investors are scrutinizing whether Big Tech can sustain its hundreds of billions in spending on AI infrastructure.

The stock got a reprieve last week after Trump eased US chip trade restrictions with the rest of the world, scrapping a Biden-era rule that was set to cap AI chip exports to most countries. Optimism over its deal to supply chips for Saudi Arabia's AI buildout also boosted the stock.

Despite his criticism of the China export ban, Huang said, ""The President has a vision of what he wants to achieve, I support the President, I believe in the President, and I think that he'll create a great outcome for America, and he'll do it with respect and with an attitude of wanting to compete, but also looking for opportunities to cooperate.""

Nvidia stock wavered Monday as market turmoil overshadowed the AI chipmaker's product update at Computex.",395

With respect to net income (first graph), Broadcom still lags Nvidia, Apple, and the four hyperscalers. However, it generated $18.9 billion in net income last year to Tesla's $5.8 billion. While both are given rich valuations (P/E ratios of 122 and 208), Broadcom's income streams are projected to grow exponentially while Tesla's have been contracting; while Tesla is projected to turn a corner, but unlike the other Mag companies, they consistently miss on street expectations, even as these expectations constantly get guided down.

As far as price action, Tesla richly awarded its shareholders many years ago. But since being added to the S&P 500 nearly five years ago (second graph), it has severely lagged the broader index and trails all of its peers except for Amazon. Meanwhile, Broadcom has consistently rewarded its shareholders with nearly 7x returns in less than five years, handily trouncing all of the Mag 8 peers except for Nvidia.

How about for year-to-date? Again (third graph), Broadcom is the leader at +32.66% YTD. Tesla brings up the rear at -10.74%.

Like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta, Broadcom is also a high margin tech company that fits the AI theme, with Apple also now making an entry into this space. Tesla is a low-margin automotive company with a high margin energy credits division and a highly speculative robotics play.",398

Don’t ever get shaken out of your conviction. In trading and life. Tough lesson here but I had to exit this trade due to life circumstances after holding Nvidia for 3 years in sideways action.  I believe these shares would be the equivalent of about $0.43 after splits.

  
I knew the potential of Nvidia in the 90s/early 2000s when I was in high school. I was building gaming computers with their chips after them taking over 3dfx (Voodoo line). My thought was if the GPU is the most important element for gaming and being able to do rapid fire complicated calculations, what is the end game for Nvidia? Well, we know the rest of the story of where that led. So, in 2011 when I started really learning about the stock market, I bought shares and just held it. I had to sell due to a large purchase and at the time, was money better utilized as the frustration of holding no movement in either direction finally got to me.",393

The market reacted slightly back then but not very much. News articles were even saying Microsoft was pausing its data center buildouts with the assumption it was because of Deepseek and the possibility of needing far fewer GPUs. They also claimed it was 10 times more efficient

4. Diversify. Everyone and their own way of doing this. Find which way works best for you.  
5. Don’t think about getting rich overnight, it takes years of DCA and scaling into a bigger portfolio and also where you will see best results(5-10+ years)
6. Always focus on maxing Roth IRA before brokerage. 
7. Why settle for the 2nd best when you can buy the best?(example; NVDA consistently outperformed AMD)

By the end of the day, the indexes closed slightly lower. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Here we go. Before the session, retail sales data was released and beat expectations. We also heard several new updates about tariffs. The White House is considering increasing the tariff rate on China by 245%. However, China has stated that they open to talks if Trump respects them. Nvidia dropped due to their new H20 chips beings blocked from sale in China. The company's current H100 chips are already banned in there. As a result, the stock dropped more than 7%. This had an effect on the indexes. And the bad news did not stop there. Fed Chair Powell says that ""The Fed will wait on rate cuts"". Of course, the stock market did not like and continued tumbling. The probability of a rate cut in May is below 15% now, but June still shows more than 50% for chance of a 25 point rate cut. The indexes dropped more than 2%. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: The decline did not continue from yesterday. Trump said that had a very productive call with the President of Mexico yesterday. He also said Japan wants to negotiate. These two positive updates effected positively on the stock market. Later on Thursday, Trump said 'He’ll leave. If I ask him to, he’ll be out of there. I don’t think he’s doing the job."" As a result, the indexes lost their gains, but still closed slightly higher. 🟢

Trump believes in lowering rates to reduce inflation. What do you think about this and its effect on the stock market? What will do the Fed or Jerome Powell? How was your week? What's your prediction for next week?

So....

If PLTR grows to become $1T from here, the gain from here would just be 100%.

The valuation is so rich, that continued growth in revenue will be required at much higher rate than what NVDA had during its bull run ( from $400 to $1T was done between 2022 to 2023). Some data pulled by chatgpt -

**And if 'AI' is the reason for PLTR's bull run, it seems highly valued compared to that of NVDA during same phase.**

At this point, it has started to make sense to book profit and reinvest in future dips. That's my reasoning based only on simple SP and growth numbers.

Also, if you are thinking to buy PLTR NOW, what's your theory and what are your realistic expectations?

* On the other hand, **small-cap stocks** are also on the rise. Several small caps are landing major contracts that are expected to double or even quintuple their revenues thanks to these investments. Why? Because they produce essential components or services that are in high demand in the defense sector. Moreover, the European plan emphasizes the involvement of small caps to benefit from the funding.

I personally hold stocks that have gained over **+40% in a single week** following the approval of the €150 billion plan, and the trend is still upward.

Now, I know you’re American and maybe not particularly interested in European stocks. But if you are, I’d be happy to share some insights, sources, and information.

1jc1mwz,2025-03-15 19:26:59,Reddit,StockMarket,NVDA,"Week Recap: Is the worst behind us? Mar. 10, 2025 - Mar. 14, 2025","First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from Mar. 7 to Mar. 14. This week,
🔷 Apple dropped more than 10%.
🔷 Nvidia surged nearly 8%. 
🔷 Intel had a strong performance after announcing a new CEO and gaining over 16% in a week.

Overall, this week was negative.

Mar. 7, 2025 Closes,
🔷 S&P500: 5,770.20
🔷 Nasdaq: 18,196.22
🔷 DJI: 42,801.72

Mar. 14, 2025 Closes,
🔷 S&P500: 5,638.94 (-2.27%)
🔷 Nasdaq: 17,754.09 (-2.37%)
🔷 DJI: 41,488.19 (-3.16%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;
Monday: Selling pressure was extremely strong. The Nasdaq dropped 727 points. It's biggest single-day decline since COVID crash on Mar. 16, 2020. 🔴
Tuesday: A quiet day. The stock market awaited key data releases on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. But, it's slightly negative. 🔴
Wednesday: CPI was released. The monthly estimate was 0.3%, but it came to 0.2%. The yearly estimate was 2.9%, but it dropped to 2.8%. This was perfect for stock market, because it's increased expectations of a rate cut. As a result, stock markets are surged more than 1%. 🟢
Tuesday: After CPI, PPI also came in below estimates. Core PPI turned negative (-0.1%) and the yearly dropped from 3.6% to 3.4%. However, tariff concerns created pressure and then the stock market dropped 2%. 🔴
Friday: The government shutdown reduced fears. The stock market jumped 2% to close the week on a strong. 🟢

S&P500 hit 6147 on February 19, 2025, but has now dropped to 5,638.94. The lowest level at this week was 5,504.65. That means, the index dropped slight more than 10%. S&P500 is below the 200-day EMA. 

If we can get 2 day consecutive positive close, some of money from other assets like gold may join the game into the stock market. For now, economic data supports the stock market, but we shouldn't forget that President Trump’s is more important than all the data and technical indicators.

1oda3f6,2025-10-22 16:39:20,Reddit,StocksAndTrading,NVDA,My mom found an old stock certificate for 170 shares of NVDA,"I was talking to my mom yesterday, who's in her early eighties, to offer to initiate a stock charitable donation from her brokerage account for the end of the year. That got her looking through her old financial papers and she found a stock certificate for 170 shares of Nvidia stock. I haven't seen it since she found it, but I have some memories of her and my dad getting a stock certificate back when they bought NVDA stock. I worked at the company for many years, and they figured they'd buy stock because I was saying good things about the company. I remember the certificate having the Nvidia logo and having purple and green on it. Purple used to be Nvidia's secondary brand color. So it's pretty old, like maybe 2002.

So I'm wondering whether this certificate is still valid and I'm wondering how splits should work with it. My understanding is that splits happen by the company creating new shares and giving them to all existing shareholders of record as of a certain date. She/they did not receive any share certificates in the mail after any of Nvidia's splits. Does that imply that this stock certificate has somehow become invalid? Or is it still worth 170 of today's shares and she's just out of luck regarding all the splits? Or does it mean that when she turns it in they will figure out how many splits she's missed and issue her the appropriate number of additional shares?

How should we negotiate the liquidation of this certificate? Who do we turn it in to? She has a Schwab brokerage account, and there's a physical Schwab office in her city, if that helps.

I should add that she has also owned NVDA in her brokerage account, and sold that some years ago. So she and the family all thought she didn't have any NVDA left, and this probably contributed to us all forgetting about the paper certificate shares.

And in case anyone's curious, neither my parents nor I have gotten filthy rich off of Nvidia or anything else. I did quite well off NVDA stock as an employee, but no one sells at precisely the right times. And for NVDA, the right time is still in the future, I believe.

**UPDATE:**

Ok, I visited my mom yesterday and saw her stock certificate. Turns out it was just a PHOTOCOPY of the actual certificate. No!!! See photo 1. They have a safe deposit box so they probably made the copy for reference, while keeping the real certificate safe. The stock certificate could still be in the deposit box, though.

I also learned the answer to the question I came here to ask - what happens with splits if you have paper certificates. I found the letter that Nvidia sent her on the 2:1 2006 split, and another for the 3:2 2007 split. See photo 2. What Nvidia did was inform them that their 170 newly issued shares were held on the books for them with the company, and could be accessed through Mellon Investor Services, while the first 170 shares were still held by the paper certificate. The paper certificate continued to represent 170 post-split shares, not 340. But this gave me a second avenue to check, with Mellon.

I went to the safe deposit box yesterday afternoon and dug through it. I found some cool stuff, including some water shares but no NVDA shares. Dang it!

So my last avenue was to call Mellon Investor Services at the number in the letter. I did that just now. Turns out the number now goes to Computer Shares, but is still Nvidia's investor services. At first they found no account with my mom's SSN, but then they looked it up by my dad's name and address and found their account. And ... drum roll, please ... All the shares were transferred to a brokerage in May 2017. Dang it!

So these were the shares that she had sold that we have a memory of. And she must've taken the share certificate from the safe deposit box at that time as well, and sold it all.

My math may be wrong, but as best I can tell they bought the 170 shares for $4386 on June 5, 2003, and sold them in May 2017 for $67,000. That's a 21.6% annualized gain, which is quite good, but a rather anticlimactic end to the story, compared to the $3.6 million that it might have been. To you who were rooting for her, as I was, sorry to disappoint. And to the few jerks who think it's ok to publicly accuse someone of lying, also sorry to disappoint.

This is yet another instance of me learning the most important rule of stock investing:

**BUY AND HOLD. Seriously, HOLD. HOLD!!!**

It day 3 for me of “shorting the market” and not getting liquidated 

At 18:34 of 22/10/2025 the pie had some more than solid return of 21.95%
With a ATH reaching 24% +/-. 
And we are reaching the end of the day at 20%+/- 

Today I had all of my allocations turning green. 

By that NBIS, RGTI and ORCL begging currently the biggest contributors. 
RGTI is close to reach the take profit of the first allocation that being 33$. 
For the second one ( that is 50% of the main one) I’m targeting 27.5$ 

For NBIS im waiting for it to fall to bellow 90s, once that happens I think it can get a bit nasty… ( or I can get liquidated with some amazing news(questionable)) 

ORCL I’m still not sure of the game play 

TSLA and NVDA almost not contributing for the pie in general (as I am writing the allocations for TSLA just turn red) 

PLRT with some returns, but às you can see from my sell price and current price is not doing amazing too, but is not helping me get liquidated and thats a good point for all I can tell. 

Once again I’ll be posting about the performance of the pie until I close all allocations. Nothing lasts forever… 

And feel free to say anything. I have this theory the more negative it is the best “The Big Shorts” performs so keep it coming!

Or when MACD crosses bearish after the stock already tanked?

I swear half my losses came from indicators that need a week to tell me what happened yesterday. By the time they ""confirm"" anything, the real money's already been made by someone else.

The whole thing is backwards. These indicators use moving averages - they're literally designed to be slow. Waiting for pivot confirmations, crossing signals, divergence ""proof""... meanwhile the stock's already moved 10%.

I have been working on reading momentum differently. Instead of averaged prices over X periods, just watching the actual fight between buyers and sellers as it happens. Like, are buyers getting exhausted RIGHT NOW, not 5 bars from now.

NVDA at $95 was a perfect example. Every traditional indicator said ""wait for confirmation."" But the real-time action was screaming that sellers were done. Next thing you know it's at $145.

That 52% move? Most of it happened while traditional indicators were still ""waiting for confirmation.""

Same story everywhere - SPX reversals, individual stocks, commodities. The exhaustion shows up immediately if you know what to look for. Not after the fact, not next week, but right when it matters.

1h9l5cb,2024-12-08 16:25:50,Reddit,StocksAndTrading,NVDA,NVDA short day story…,"About a year ago in March of 2023, NVDA stock was soaring high. Was climbing fast without any significant pullbacks. 

So here is a story of one of the greatest positions I put on for a day trade unintentionally. 


I attached a picture of NVDAs chart and its rally, the next trading day after this picture was a Friday. 

SMCI the Friday before had a massive sell off in one day dropping over 100 points. 

So I looked at NVDA chart the night before RSI was in the 90s (very very high) and it was also a Friday so I was looking short. 

I run a window cleaning business also so the next day I had a job at 9:30. 
I said to myself either I see this going to over 1,000$ or today will be the pullback it needs like SMCI the week prior. 

I bought 10 contracts of the 900P expiring the same day for 50$ a piece. And I’m ngl I forgot about the position. 

I started trading 4-5 years ago, so in college I used to catch massive moves on small positions like for example a 100$ premium option turning into 1,000$ premium. 
So I have had similar experiences with these moves. 


Around 12pm I check my position and notice that the price of NVDA opened at 973$ and was currently at 876$ making my position now ITM on that same day. 
I sold all 10 of my options contracts for 1670$ at 12pm. 
Making this trade one of my best trades I have ever made. 

A couple things I took from this trade, the market is eerie sometimes meaning, a lot of similarities happen in the market if you can identify them you can make money. 

2.) My position size was so small that i legitimately forgot about it and didn’t care if it went to 0. 
If I put more money on this position say 2-5k there is no way I would’ve caught the entire move because I would have been watching it more closely and wouldn’t have accepted the risk the same. 

3.) this setup was A+. So when I say the set up was A+ I’m not saying that I “Predicted” the stock to drop this much in 1 trading day. 
But I took my prior knowledge on what I saw happen the week prior and tested my theory on it with NVDA. 

Lastly, never give up trading since this trade I have remained profitable and continue to learn and adapt in the market. 

I thought I would share this for anyone that believes one thing in the market, doesn’t do it and they happen to be right. 

If you identify recurring patterns test out your theories with proper risk management and let the trade play out. ",8
1munyiz,2025-08-19 18:50:18,Reddit,StocksAndTrading,NVDA,Coming from futures - how do YOU pick stocks to daytrade?,"I have a workflow, but wanted to check does that make sense and is there anything I could do to improve my picks.

I have a list of ""resident"" stocks, about 15ish, on my quote board. Those have avg. daily volume from about 3 M(NFLX) to 10 M(META).  They're from various sectors. I avoided tickers like NVDA as PA is similar to that of NQ and ES, as those stocks make such a huge % of those indices. Those liquid but not crazy liquid stocks seem to be the sweet spot for how I trade. I go daily thru that list before the open, and mark my levels, pick a few tickers that have PA which caught my eye.

Then there's the Tradingview screener. My filters there are; pre-market volume(over 150k), pre-market gap %(1% or more), avg 10 day volume(3M-25M), price(more than 15$), market cap (10B-500B), exchanges(NYSE, NASDAQ), country(US only), ATR 14(over 2%), symbol type(common stock).  
Based on those filters, it spits out a couple of stocks per day. Last two days were a bit slow, so there were less picks, but last week I had 5-6 tickers/day on that list. That combined with my list of ""residents"" is plenty, so I'm not looking to add more. but rather to improve my process if possible, ditch tickers that don't work for me and add those with PA that suits the way I trade.  
  
For the way I trade, I basically need a momentum to form, so the less chop and very tight ranges the better. In the short time I've been using this workflow, I was able to find more solid setups in a week in stocks than during whole July in futures.   
However, as stocks are a new beast for me I might be missing something in my workflow. Maybe there's a way to refine it and end up with a list of stocks that tend to have nice moves quite often. I know I'll end up with it with time, after I get to know a bunch of tickers.  But as there are more experienced people here, when it comes to stocks, I'd like to hear how you do your daily picks and is there anything to add or change in my workflow that could improve it...?",8

Days later it dropped big and it scared me shitless.  I had to wait months for it to finally get back to break even, and the moment it did, I got out.  It felt great getting my money back.  Then, of course, it kept trending up.  I never got back in.

Then that flash crash happened.  I had a feeling that crash would happen, and told myself that when it did, I would get back in.  It happened, and I was worried it would crash more, never got in.  I convinced myself I would be better off using the money to buy a house.

Every day now I think about how my intuition basically instructed me on how and when to play, and my emotional side took control and pushed me out of the plays.

 I just can’t get over it.  Nearly every day I obsess about it.  I’m reaching out here to get some insight, maybe therapeutic help.  I hate myself and fear I will get into some other stock, trying to mirror the experience and losing everything.",8

In the current secondary market, chips are no longer the most favored AI investment target. Instead, the spotlight has shifted to AI applications. The U.S. stock market's ""AI+"" trend is producing an increasing number of standout performers.

Recently, AI application stock $**Applovin (APP.US)** reached a new all-time high, with its stock price surging over 850% year-to-date and a market cap exceeding $100 billion, continuing to fuel the AI narrative. Meanwhile, **Palantir (PLTR.US)**, known for its ""AI+Defense"" focus, has also risen an impressive 318% this year.

According to Menlovc data, overall enterprise AI spending has grown from $2.3 billion last year to $13.8 billion this year. While foundational models remain the largest area of expenditure, spending on model deployment and application layers is accelerating at a faster pace.

Here are some potential stocks across various AI-related segments:

* **Software – Infrastructure**: $FTNT, $YEXT, $GTLB, $ADBE, $NTNX, $BOX, $ZS

On one hand, Nvidia continues to dominate the AI and data center space, with demand for its next-gen Blackwell chips reaching unprecedented levels. Strategic partnerships with tech giants like AWS, Microsoft, and Google have solidified its position as the undisputed leader in the industry.📈

But here’s where things get complicated.

Recent stock sell-offs, partly triggered by Marvell's earnings report, have cast a shadow over the entire AI semiconductor sector, and Nvidia is no exception. To add fuel to the fire, fraud allegations surrounding Nvidia chips in Singapore have raised serious questions about the company’s supply chain, adding to investor concerns📉

While some analysts remain incredibly bullish, with price targets as high as $200, others like seasoned fund manager Doug Kass are predicting a sharp correction, with prices potentially plummeting to the $50-$75 range, citing Nvidia’s high valuation and growing risks.

Are we about to witness Nvidia's stock continue its meteoric rise, or are we staring down the barrel of a massive correction? Could we see prices sink below $90? 🤔",6

Then today…. enter the world's second biggest copper mine that goes offline after an accident, the physical metal goes vertical, and suddenly everyone remembers our beautiful digital cloud is built with dirty, physical rocks.

It really is a beautiful, and violent reminder that the real world still has veto power over the metaverse narrative.

This is the physical economy margin calling the digital one and the pairs trade of the day is screamingly obvious: long copper futures, short Freeport-McMoRan.

It's the cleanest expression of the thing is now more valuable than the company that digs up the thing.

But here's the kicker….. even the safe tech plays are just political theater now.

Intel is fresh off its government blessed shakedown of Nvidia, and is hitting up Apple for its next round of funding. This isn't a capital raise; it's a GoFundMe campaign for American industrial policy.

The US isn’t giving Argentina a $20 billion swap line because its credit is good; it's a political lifeline to prop up an ideological ally until an election.

The tape is telling us the only two trades left are the physically scarce stuff that actually runs the world, and the politically sponsored narratives the government wants you to believe in, and maybe a few ""dank"" meme stocks or crypto added in for those with high blood pressure….

So what's the play? Are we just supposed to long rocks and fade the Argentina lifeline rally into oblivion, any other moves here yall looking at?

I lost 110k over the past month. The majority after options calls during the bloodbath after december fed meeting. 
 
If i could go back to my past self, i would say this. The loss isn't worth the potential gains. Before, I was just burnt out from my job. But at least i was proud to have saved up my first 100k. Now im burnt out, down 3 years of savings, and have a lot less freedom in my life.  I can't focus on work, i'm depressed and can't find joy in my hobbies anymore. I'm probably in the process of ruining my relationship as well. Even if i had won, i definitely don't think I'd be happier an equivalent amount. 

Life is hard. If you worked hard and earned some money. Dont make degenerate bets. The vast majority of us are just normal humans who should just save their time and invest in part index fund and part cash equivalents.

Or maybe this marks the bottom and it is a buying opportunity. Your choice. 

EDIT
Was only expecting maybe max 100 upvotes but i guess I said something that resonates. 

After wading through the comments, insults, memes, etc. I was touched by enough kind people reaching out to add some more. I dont think i can stomach another comment reading though so please dont expect me to react anymore. Notifications are off. Posted a 80k loss screenshot of part of my portfolio. Another 30k was lost in another account. https://imgur.com/a/jMvs9DR

1. ""only bet what you can afford to lose"" doesn’t really make sense. Dont use that saying to convince yourself to make risky gambles. I could afford to lose 110k in the sense that i won't starve, i would still have a roof over my head, and i still have 30k i left that i promised to myself i wouldnt touch. But i lost things i didn't expect. Like my passions for my hobbies, a healthy exercise habit, my mental health after recovering from depression during college. Even during the time i was trading, i also hated how it felt. I was glued to the ticker and was losing connection with real life relationships.  Before you use the money you think you are willing to lose. Try spending a part of that amount on yourself. Get yourself some luxuries, some experiences, maybe travel, take a sabbatical from work, or spend it on someone close to you.  Its all numbers on the screen when trading, so its easy to lose a sense of it all. Afterwards, imagine losing the ability to do all that and only proceed if youre ok with that. 

2. For those who think this isnt something a normal person could go through. I saved roughly 60-70% of my paycheck the past 3 years. I made sacrifices on lifestyle and luxuries. 

3. For those that still want to go on, i sure cant stop you. Maybe some of us need to learn a lesson firsthand. Might be better even to learn early on before you have a family with hundreds of thousands saved up over decades. This might help. 

Looking back, i definitely had chances to make money.  I was thinking about RKLB when it was $5 (now $25). I had a chance to jump into RDDT when it was still $80. I considered googl at 165 since the bad news seemed overblown.   Even at my most insane already down 50k, before i lost it all i almost went all in in on christmas eve with 1 week dte options on tsla calls.  Instead i did it on the Friday afterwards hoping for a similar bounce to recover the from the drop after fed earnings.  If you get into single stocks, crypto, options it's a lot riskier. Youre going to have to be lucky with the timing. Youre also going to have to be disciplined with your strategy.  

When you make your bet. If you win, stop.  i hope you become happy. I hope you get more time to pursue your passions. To spend time with family and friends. To become a person you are proud of. 

If you lose, i hope you recover. Never gamble again. Life will be harder. But, maybe we can still find a part of that happiness. I dont think we really want money. We just want a more human experience. ",7857

1grqiw1,2024-11-15 07:49:43,Reddit,wallstreetbets,TSLA,Those who think removing the EV tax credit will help Tesla are smoking some exotic copium. Here's my crystal ball.,"1. Trump removes $7,500 EV tax credits and imposes import tariffs on all imported EVs.
2. The US EV manufacturers are starved out, and Tesla is the only surviving US EV maker - I quote ""Tesla does not depend on subsidies"".
3. Tesla increases its US EV market share, seemingly as the only car manufacturer without risk of discontinuity.
4. Nonetheless, Tesla delivery numbers remain stagnant despite increased US market share due to lowering overall EV sales.
5. Tesla now monopolises the US EV market, significantly diluting the need to compete.
6. US import tariffs are now in full effect. Imported parts are too expensive, and cost-cutting is prioritised. Tesla's costly R&D takes a backseat.
7. China, Korea and the Germans retaliate by imposing tariffs on Tesla imports, crippling Tesla's global market EV share.
8. Chinese, Korean and German EV makers continue to improve EV capabilities in a 3-cornered fight, widening the tech gap to Tesla.
9. The difference in EVs has now become more apparent. Tesla now lacks value for money and is no longer relevant to the global market. The US is dethroned as a major EV leader.
10. Tesla now struggles to sustain revenue growth without the global market. It now struggles to justify its colossal trillion-dollar valuation. Tesla needs to milk the already-drying US harder, somehow.
11. A new generation of Tesla bag holders is created.

  
Edit: Hundreds of ya all only read point 7 and started refuting how Tesla has factories in China and Germany, so there aren't tariffs, clear skies, etc. Look, when this trade war starts, these countries will want blood. Tesla is not only the US hallmark of EVs, but its flamboyant boss is now part of the US administration that initiated the sanctions. The countries, especially the Chinese, will hit where it hurts the most.",7148

1k5sxqo,2025-04-23 09:03:21,Reddit,wallstreetbets,TSLA,The Market didn't care about Tesla's Earnings. Here's why. TLDR? It's not rigged,"Everyone’s tripping out about why Tesla is ripping after awful earnings, so here’s what’s actually going on,  and what might happen tomorrow and the next few weeks. Tesla reported after hours. Margins are down, revenue is weak, guidance is fuzzy, and Elon pulled out the usual robotaxi speech, tariffs are bad, cheaper cars, robots making cars.... But instead of tanking, the stock jumped. Why?

Short answer: markets don’t just trade the news,  they trade positioning and expectations.

Here’s how it works:

Before earnings, implied volatility (IV) was high. That means options,  especially puts,  were expensive. Everyone was hedging or speculating on a big drop. If you bought puts, you and everyone else were betting Tesla would move more than the expected range.

But Tesla didn’t crash. It didn’t even dip. It went up.

So tomorrow morning, we will likely see IV crush when IV drops hard after earnings. That’s where Vega comes in. Vega measures how much an option’s price changes in relation to its implied volatility (IV). If you’re holding puts, and IV collapses, those options lose value quickly, even if Tesla trades in your direction or sideways.

Now let’s talk about the feedback loop; this is where things get interesting. Market makers (dealers) are usually on the other side of all those puts. If they sell you a put, they’re taking on directional risk; if Tesla drops, they lose. So to protect themselves, they hedge.

For puts, that means shorting the stock to stay neutral. If the stock drops, their short hedge offsets their option losses.

But if the stock doesn’t drop,  or even worse, it goes up, they have to buy back their hedge to avoid getting wrecked. That buying pushes the stock price higher. And as the stock goes higher, they need to buy more to stay hedged. That’s a gamma feedback loop.

Add in short sellers covering their positions and a few retail traders chasing the pop, and suddenly you have a rally that feeds itself, even if the earnings were bad.

But it doesn’t mean the move is real or sustainable.

The big dogs (institutions) haven’t even acted yet. They’ll dissect the call overnight and into the next day. Some might sell the rip. Some might rebalance slowly over a few days. The real move sometimes doesn’t hit until later.

Let’s be real,  this game isn’t just about puts and calls. Market makers, hedge funds, and institutional players have access to insane levels of data. They have entire teams of quants, analysts, PhDs, and machines that track options flow, gamma exposure, CBOE positioning, bond yields, Fed swaps, commodities, FX correlations; you name it. They don’t just trade the headlines; they trade the reaction to positioning around the headlines. They model the crowd’s behavior before the crowd even makes a move.

If this were as simple as “bad earnings = buy puts,” everyone would be rich. But it’s not. The options market is one of the deepest and most complex systems on the market. That’s why insider trading is illegal, and why billionaires get into politics,  to legally front-run the economy and gain access to real-time information that actually moves markets. That’s why your broker has analytics for gamma exposure, skew, delta hedging zones, not because it’s nice to have, but because it’s necessary if you want to survive in this ecosystem.

Yeah, some retail traders make big money, sometimes,  but that’s gambling. Without context, you’re flipping a coin. 

This wasn’t about fundamentals. It was about positioning, hedging mechanics, and options flow.  
The market punished the crowded trade, as it always does.

So no, the system isn’t rigged. It’s just math, flow, and positioning. The market punishes the crowded trade. Too many people bet on a collapse, so the opposite happened.

Welcome to the dealer’s game.",6472

1jiqjas,2025-03-24 14:22:21,Reddit,wallstreetbets,TSLA,"Volkswagen, BMW group electric cars outsell Tesla in Europe in February","(Reuters) - Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) EV sales in Europe have fallen in February behind legacy brand Volkswagen ([VOW3.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW3.DE), [VLKPF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VLKPF)) and the BMW ([BMW.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMW.DE)) group, as well as rivals from China, data by research platform JATO Dynamics showed on Monday.

Elon Musk's all-electric brand is facing a loyalty test in Europe after the close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump openly supported far-right parties in the continent, including with at least two dozen posts on his X platform promoting Germany's Alternative fur Deutschland.

Musk's role in politics, rising competition in the EV market and the phasing out of the existing version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, have all impacted sales, Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a report.

""Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover,"" Munoz said.

Tesla's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland fell on average by 44% from the same month of 2024, to under 16,000 cars sold in February. Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.

By comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.

Chinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.

BYD's ([1211.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1211.HK), [BYDDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY)) and Polestar's ([PSNY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY)) BEV sales in the same markets were up respectively 94% and 84% to over 4,000 and over 2,000 cars. Xpeng ([XPEV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV), [9868.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9868.HK)) sold over 1,000 cars and Leapmotor ([9863.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9863.HK)) almost 900.

BEV sales at Geely ([0175.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/0175.HK), [GELYF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GELYF)) -owned Volvo and SAIC ([600104.SS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/600104.SS))-owned MG, instead, dropped by 30% and 67% respectively, the data showed.

My fellow regards, I believe it’s time to call bullshit on this market. Please understand, I don’t care who you voted for… I guarantee I like you a hell of a lot more than I like the banks, and that is exactly who the winner is going to be unless people wake up to the reality of our situation quickly. 

Before touching any kind of political news, let’s start with market indicators. 

BofA’s recent mm survey showed that most MM’s are reducing their share of US equities (source 1 below), there are other signs the banks are getting out as well (check my second to last post), BlackRock is struggling to find buyers. 

At the same time, a record number of American households now own stock in US equities (source 2 below). Now, from what I know about American households (I live in one), most of us live paycheck to paycheck… we don’t really have money to put into stocks willy-nilly.


So what does all of this mean? 

Well, my thesis is that the average American has their rent/mortgage in US equities tied up in stocks like Tesla right now as an act of patriotism… what saddens me most is that I appreciate this general sentiment (not for Tesla necessarily, but I do actually love my country despite what the news may tell you), but the banks are taking advantage of it. So what happens when all the sudden everyone has to pay their bills? 

That’s right… another mass sell off. 

Please believe me when I say that I hope I’m wrong, this is not going to be good for average, working people with, at the very least, good-hearted intentions… but I don’t see any signs to indicate that I am.

Now we’ll touch a bit on economic outlook and history:

We are currently still in a battle with inflation, JPow said it yesterday, even before tariffs we were looking at 2 more years before we return to normal and the outlook with tariffs puts it all on pause. He hedged to say ‘they aren’t sure how tariffs will affect inflation’, let me fill in the gap there: either tariffs will affect inflation (because the costs are passed on to consumers) or they will affect earnings (because companies absorb them)… the money has to come from somewhere. If it affects inflation, the fed will be forced to raise interest rates or at the very least pause on cuts indefinitely. If it doesn’t affect inflation, it will affect earnings/growth… if this sounds familiar, then you may have heard of stagflation. And if you study the history of the federal reserve, you may know what the solution to that problem is… Volcker’s hammer. You can look it up yourself but the gist is that in the late 70’s we had been battling inflation and stagnant growth for years, until Paul Volcker was appointed to head the federal reserve and raised interest rates to 20%… it absolutely crushed the economy, sent us to the stone ages… but it did reset our inflation and led us into a very booming 80’s. 

I want to reiterate… I don’t like either side politically, they’re all in bed with the banks. The only reason I’m posting this is because I’m angry at the thought of them getting super leveraged on overpriced stocks and then dumping it on average people. This has so many shades of 2008 it’s not funny. Feel free to argue, bet against me, whatever… I genuinely don’t care. I’ve been a value investor since I was 14 and I’m currently 28. I held through 2020 and 2022, this time feels much much different. 

Whatever you decide to do with this information, be safe out there.

(Bloomberg) — One of Wall Street’s most bullish Tesla Inc. analysts slashed his price target for the stock by 43%, citing a brand crisis created by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump’s trade policies.

“Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally,” Daniel Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst who’s rated the carmaker’s shares a buy for the last four years, wrote in a report to clients Sunday. “It is time for Musk to step up, read the room, and be a leader in this time of uncertainty.”

Ives reduced his Tesla share-price target to $315 from $550, which had been the second-highest among the 72 analysts tracked by Bloomberg.

Ives’ biggest concern is the potential for Tesla to get caught up in backlash against the US president’s tariff policies in China, where Tesla generated more than a fifth of its revenue last year. President Xi Jinping’s government plans to impose a 34% tariff on all imports from the US starting April 10, matching the level of Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs on Chinese products.

“This will further drive Chinese consumers to buy domestic such as BYD, Nio, Xpeng and others,” Ives said in his note issued Sunday. “We now estimate Tesla has lost/destroyed at least 10% of its future customer base globally based on self-created brand issues, and this could be a conservative estimate.”

Tesla shares plunged 15% in the two days after Trump announced he would apply at least a 10% tariff on all countries’ imports into the US, with even higher duties on some 60 nations to counter trade imbalances. The stock has fallen 50% from its record high reached Dec. 17.",2995

* The problem is that Iridium couldn’t sell the service. It was expensive (for the specialized headset and by the minute in its use), people didn’t know it existed (Iridium were engineers not marketers), a market didn’t exist (maritime and remote villages and niche minute by minute sales does not a market make).

   * ASTS solves this with its super wholesale model where AT&T, Verizon, Rakuten, Vodaphone, and others do all the marketing, all the sales, all the billing, and upsell their existing customer base for a service they want anyway (more on this later).

      * ASTS does not need to find customers. Their agreements with the above give them instant access to 3B paying handsets overnight.

      * ASTS does not need to sell the world a new device. Every cell phone just works.

That is the entire story that valued ASTS to its core investors since it started trading as a SPAC. While every single ASTS long term investor lost the love of their wives as the stock cratered to 1.98, the story changed. Five additional pillars have been layered on top of the above original thesis which makes me (and you if you are capable of reading) more bullish. They are as follows:

2) Military Applications Non-Communications Use

* The large array and patented technology have more uses than just communications with cell phones.

   * They can be used as an alternative to GPS, for Missile Tracking, for PNT, and more.

   * Any piece of military equipment that can accept a small wireless chip can use ASTS.

   * The future of war is remote drone operations. They need connection. ASTS does that too.

* ASTS was awarded (through a prime contractor) a United States Space Development Agency (SDA) contract worth $43 million

   * This is for 6 satellites for one year and paid out linearly.

   * Fairwinds advertisement for the service shows ASTS communicating with existing Military Satellites.

   * This award will likely be expanded as more satellites come into service.

* Hybrid Acquisition for proliferated Low-earth Orbit (HALO) program

   * ASTS was awarded a starter contract as their own prime.

   * The program can cover launch and parts costs on top of service payments.

   * End game of this is ASTS use for missile tracking in the “Golden Dome” the Trump administration wants to build out.

3) European Monopoly / Satco Joint Venture with Vodaphone

* ASTS and Vodaphone created a joint venture for all of Europe where they will sell the service to other European Telcos. They will also be offering the service to the European Government much like the company is currently doing in the US.

   * Importantly all the data will be sent and received entirely in the EU. All infrastructure will live in the EU. It will be an entirely European Company to be more marketable in Europe.

* All of this has happened as Elon is nuking his rep in Europe with “roman” salutes and threating to withhold Ukraine’s access to Starlink. People are realizing that Elon is not dependable, and they need alternatives. ASTS is that alternative.

4) The company has begun to acquire Ligado Spectrum to create their own data service which does not rely on the leasing of spectrum from AT&T and Verizon.

* This Ligado spectrum has been unusable in the past due to interference with GPS and military spectrum in nearby bands.

   * Ligado was using this Satellite Spectrum as Terrestrial with FCC waivers unsuccessfully.

   * ASTS brings value to this spectrum through its beam forming which results in no interference.

* Spectrum can be valued on a per mhz per population basis.

   * At .40 - .80 /MHz-pop \* 40 MHZ \* 330M people in the United States we can value this spectrum at \~8Billion dollars.

      * This is the entire Market Cap of ASTS as it stands today.

      * The company is acquiring the exclusive use of this spectrum for far below this cost. (350M + 4.7M penny warrants + 80M / year + small revenue share)

      * The value of spectrum based on previous auctions likely discounts the future value of spectrum based on the number of connected devices we will be seeing in the future. There is more upside than the $8B figure represents (see point 5Bi).

   * ASTS does its own design and manufacturing and is already designing a new satellite to work with its Ligado spectrum.

   * This deal closing will allow ASTS to sell capacity to its partners or offer their own service ala Starlink.

5) AI requires constant connectivity

* [Facebook is spending $10B to put fiber underwater for bigger pipes for their own data](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/29/meta-plans-to-build-a-10b-subsea-cable-spanning-the-world-sources-say/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAB9Zn-QxaAgZypcTXZnX7qnT_XW8Gtm4Lo4e7AnQZD3d-HkWV24RLmg0B_RTon33a68Fc4NrzIVFSP-WXsOWjJOjFeE1wLz0KSRP2ZuVXG6ExThE5kmYcSVrb7JhUouBqIV1sWg4g1T-G7jWRobaSH1MIwaH3ANKhUl_xh4xsg7X). That’s all that you need to know about where the biggest companies believe data is going with the introduction of AI. ASTS solves this and blankets the entire earth with data connectivity (albeit with less speed).

   * However, building this giant globe spanning fiber still does not solve the issue of connectivity in the outer reaches of the planet. This is just for the easily accessible areas meaning ASTS still provides value in data delivery which may be of use to companies like Facebook.

* Autonomous AI Agents need connection and backup connections to operate. Data delivery in all corners of the world matters to make use of AI.

* Think of every time you have paid $20 for internet on a plane. You need it access to data too, even if you think AI doesn’t (it does).

   * Consider the number of connected “things” you have now. Airtags, smart watches, phones, laptops, cars, trucks, fucking killer drones from Palmer Lucky, farm equipment, doorbells, your wife’s WiFi Dildo that actually makes her cum unlike you, your WiFi buttplug, etc. All of this adds value to the ability to reliably deliver internet to all corners of the planet. That is ASTS’ market.

6) Space is strategic

* When I first wrote about the company I thought Elon and Bezos were just playing with the new billionaires toy of rockets. It turns out they were just one step ahead of the game. Space is strategic and having access to your own internet is incredibly valuable given the need for constant connection with AI. They know this and are leveraging their launch capacity to build out their own private internet.

* ASTS benefits from an increase in launch capacity by having these billionaires fight for ASTS billions of dollars in launch costs. ASTS can essentially play king maker. Every dollar which goes to Blue Origin isn’t going to SpaceX and vice versa. ASTS future launch cadence with its \~150 launches represents billions in launch costs. They can make the below fight for the lowest cost to get this future business. Note: ASTS already has agreements for 60 launches into the end of 2026. At 20 satellites the company expects to be at cash flow breakeven.

* Don't bet against the below. The Space Trade will come.

   * Elon Musk – Starlink SpaceX

   * Jeff Bezos – Blue Origin New Glenn Kupier

   * Eric Schmidt – Relativity

   * Peter Beck – Rocket Lab

   * Abel Avellan - ASTS

  
Before one of you morons say “waaaaaa but what about starlink?” shut the fuck up and get out of my DD. Thanks. Starlink proper does not speak to cell phones which is why they require end users to have a dish or a mini dish to use their service. Their direct to cell solution with T-Mobile is not purpose built and has failed to deliver simple text messages. Take some time to read reviews of their service. It is complete shit and has no hopes of delivering broadband speed like ASTS without a complete redesign (which is probably difficult given that their lead engineer for D2C just left the company. Not a great look innit?). Alright with that out of the way we can continue. The rest of this writeup I completed for school and is a technical writeup of the company. Enjoy or whatever. There is very little information about the business valuation because I am not smart like that (or in any other way but neither are you). **If you want to know more**, read u/thekookreport ‘s DD [document](https://www.kookreport.com/post/ast-spacemobile-asts-the-mobile-satellite-cellular-network-monopoly-please-find-my-final-comp). ***It is incredible and if you take the time to read it you might have the conviction required to acquire generational wealth. Good luck!*** Anyways here ya go bud:

**Company and Industry Background**

AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) is pioneering direct-to-device satellite connectivity, enabling standard, unmodified smartphones to connect directly to satellites for broadband cellular service. This groundbreaking technology positions ASTS uniquely to deliver global mobile broadband coverage, especially in areas lacking traditional terrestrial infrastructure. Through large, powerful phased-array antennas deployed on satellites in low Earth orbit, ASTS creates ""cell towers in space"" which provide seamless connectivity without the need for specialized satellite phones or additional equipment like satellite dishes.

Globally, approximately 2.6 billion people lack internet access (World Economic Forum), primarily due to economic barriers in deploying terrestrial networks in remote or sparsely populated regions. ASTS addresses this significant digital divide by allowing these individuals to access broadband services using any existing smartphone.

*According to Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (“GSMA”), as of December 31, 2024, approximately 5.8 billion mobile subscribers are constantly moving in and out of coverage, approximately 3.4 billion people have no cellular broadband coverage and approximately 350.0 million people have no connectivity or mobile cellular coverage*.

There are approximately 6.8 Billion smartphones in the world all of which would be compatible with ASTS service on Day 1 without any modifications required as their service purely mimics existing GSMA service. As global connectivity becomes increasingly essential, particularly with the rapid expansion and integration of artificial intelligence, the value of ASTS grows exponentially.

ASTS strategically targets underserved regions in both developed and developing markets, focusing on areas where conventional terrestrial infrastructure is economically impractical or geographically challenging. The company's approach aligns with the FCC's Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) framework (FCC-23-22A1), which outlines the means of providing cell phone coverage from space and necessitates spectrum leasing agreements with established Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). Recognizing this requirement, ASTS has secured strategic investments from industry leaders such as Google, AT&T, Verizon, American Tower, and Vodafone. These investments validate ASTS's technological and business approach, simultaneously offering traditional MNOs a beneficial partnership. Operators like AT&T and Verizon benefit by monetizing their spectrum in otherwise unused regions. This also benefits MNOs and American Tower by effectively hedging their terrestrial tower businesses against the propagation of space-based service and maximizing existing assets and valuable spectrum.

Unlike conventional satellite phone providers or systems such as Starlink and Project Kuiper, which compensate for smaller satellite footprints by relying heavily on extensive ground infrastructure, ASTS's design is distinct. It employs significantly larger satellite antenna arrays, enabling direct communication with regular mobile phones without modifications. The large antennas generate a robust, ""loud"" signal from space, capable of directly reaching unmodified consumer devices—contrasting sharply with traditional satellite phones, which rely on devices actively searching for faint satellite signals. Additionally, ASTS's larger arrays dramatically reduce the total number of satellites needed for global coverage. For instance, while Project Kuiper plans to deploy 3,236 satellites and Starlink already operates over 8,000 satellites, ASTS aims to achieve global coverage with approximately 168 satellites. This not only optimizes efficiency but also addresses growing concerns about orbital congestion and space debris.

The wholesale go-to-market strategy adopted by ASTS leverages existing customer bases from mobile network operators, providing a significant competitive advantage. Unlike previous satellite endeavors, such as Iridium—which faced challenges not with technology but with market adoption due to high costs and complex marketing—ASTS offers a straightforward, accessible solution that integrates seamlessly with existing mobile ecosystems. The model ensures rapid adoption and scalability, delivering reliable broadband service globally without the barriers encountered by traditional satellite communication providers.

To further enhance customer accessibility and peace of mind, ASTS offers flexible pricing options such as day passes and affordable monthly fees, ensuring users remain consistently connected wherever they travel. This model caters to the growing expectation of constant connectivity, as increasingly more devices—including cars, smartwatches, location trackers, and other IoT gadgets—rely on continuous internet access. Consumers regularly demonstrate willingness to pay for reliable connectivity, just think of every time you have paid or considered paying $24.99 for in-flight Wi-Fi.

*In fact, early findings show nearly two-thirds of subscribers are willing to pay extra \[for satellite connectivity\], with about half open to \~$5/month for off-grid connectivity*

**Source(s) of innovation**

When a cell phone initiates a call or sends data, the signal travels through an uplink from the device to the nearest cell tower. At the tower’s base station, this signal is processed and forwarded through a high-capacity connection known as backhaul, typically via fiber-optic cables or microwave links, toward the network core. The network core functions like the network's brain, determining the signal’s destination and routing it accordingly. From the network core, the call or data is directed out through the appropriate aggregation points and backhaul connections toward the recipient’s nearest tower. At this final cell tower, the signal is sent via a downlink directly to the receiving user’s phone, completing the communication.

https://preview.redd.it/p4kc3cr740we1.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe5eb433f21ef132dd8abc60d8216506e65c150b

In contrast, ASTS' approach replaces traditional cell towers and terrestrial backhaul infrastructure with satellites positioned in low Earth orbit. When a phone communicates with AST's BlueBird satellite, the uplink signal travels directly from the user's phone to the satellite itself, acting as a ""tower in space."" The satellite processes and beams the signal back down to strategically located ground gateways that connect to the terrestrial network core, bypassing the extensive network of ground towers and traditional backhaul. The core network then routes the call or data to the recipient, either via terrestrial towers or via another satellite beam. This approach effectively removes geographic barriers, delivering cellular connectivity even in remote or underserved areas where traditional terrestrial infrastructure is unavailable or economically impractical.

https://preview.redd.it/xwbphlj840we1.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=d87b8e32dabc983d52690b9cc247a75357722035

Starlink has recently gained significant attention with its high-profile Super Bowl advertisement showcasing their satellite texting offering with T-Mobile, bringing public awareness to direct-to-device (D2D) connectivity (Mobile World Live). However, despite this increased visibility, Starlink faces inherent technological limitations in its beam-forming capabilities. The satellite's antennas generate broad, flashlight-like beams that cover large geographical areas but lack precision. This approach leads to increased interference with neighboring networks and limits Starlink's ability to efficiently reuse spectrum, ultimately restricting network capacity and data throughput for individual users.

Starlink's beam design contrasts sharply with more advanced D2D satellite systems that utilize precise, narrowly-focused beams to minimize interference and maximize spectrum efficiency. Due to Starlink's broader beam coverage, each satellite can serve fewer distinct user groups simultaneously, which reduces overall service quality and speed per user. As a result, while Starlink's high-profile marketing has drawn consumer attention to satellite-based mobile connectivity, its practical applications remain constrained, particularly in densely populated or interference-sensitive areas where efficient beam management and high throughput are critical.

Comparatively, ASTS employs significantly narrower, laser-focused beams enabled by their large phased-array antennas, as detailed in FCC filings (FCC 20200413-00034). ASTS satellites can generate beams as narrow as less than one degree, precisely targeting coverage areas and significantly reducing interference. In contrast, Starlink’s FCC filings (FCC 1091870146061) indicate beam widths that can span tens or hundreds of kilometers, with antenna gains around 38 dBi, resulting in broader coverage but increased interference and reduced spectral efficiency. ASTS's advanced beam-forming capabilities allow for precise, efficient frequency reuse and higher overall throughput per user, providing a notable advantage over Starlink in both performance and spectrum management.

https://preview.redd.it/xgl7egn940we1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b23b49ff581a6570c470fb5666a6006417d6fd50

https://preview.redd.it/cfcf2mka40we1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=cedc4388c33eef2189cebc720f5327cdf5091649



The top image taken from FCC Filings represents the antenna pattern for ASTS' system, akin to a laser pointer, with a very sharp, narrow central beam and significantly lower sidelobes. This tight focus ensures the energy is highly concentrated, minimizing interference with other areas and maximizing the signal strength in the intended coverage zone. Conversely, the bottom image illustrates Starlink's broader beam pattern, similar to a flashlight, with a wide central lobe and substantial sidelobes. The broader distribution of energy leads to greater interference and less precise coverage, reducing overall network efficiency and limiting the achievable throughput per user.

ASTS innovation is best shown in their extensive patent portfolio some of which protect this signal creation. 

https://preview.redd.it/fzqf4ijb40we1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=2112a61c00314bf51eb1de3a0837501f7067bc96

ASTS utilizes significantly larger satellites featuring advanced phased-array antennas that unfold in orbit, allowing them to generate stronger and more precise signals directly to standard mobile phones. The satellite itself employs a straightforward ""bent pipe"" design, which simply receives signals from phones and redirects them toward ground gateways without complex onboard processing. The sophisticated management of signals is handled by ASTS's proprietary software on the ground, ensuring seamless integration with existing mobile carrier networks and compatibility with current and future mobile technologies (including 6G). We can examine some key patents  from the company to gain a better understanding of their technology advantage:

**Mechanical Deployable Structure for LEO:** This patent covers AST’s deployment mechanism for its large flat satellites​. The satellite’s antenna array is made of many square/rectangular panels (with solar on one side and antennas on the other) hinged together with spring-loaded connectors. These stored-energy hinges (often called spring tapes) automatically unfold the panels into a contiguous flat array once the satellite is in space, without needing motors or power to do the deployment. In essence, the satellite launches compactly folded up, and when it reaches orbit, it pops open on its own like a spring-loaded blanket. This is a core enabler for ASTS business: it allows them to fit a very large antenna into a small launch volume and reliably deploy it in orbit​. The self-deploying design reduces complexity and points of failure (since fewer motors or controls are needed), lowering launch and manufacturing costs. Successfully deploying a massive antenna is critical for AST’s service capability.

https://preview.redd.it/7iewd2jc40we1.png?width=823&format=png&auto=webp&s=6561e0f1bf475df91dddb0b405ce48f860b72ad4

**Integrated Antenna Module with Thermal Management:** This patent describes the flat antenna module that integrates solar cells and radio antennas into one structure and includes built-in cooling features​. In simple terms, each panel on ASTS satellite serves as both a power source (via solar cells) and a communication antenna, while also dissipating its own heat. This means the satellite can be made up of many such panels tiled into the huge antenna array above without overheating. This innovation allows ASTS to deploy very large, power-efficient antennas in orbit, enabling stronger signals and broad coverage for mobile users without the weight or complexity of separate cooling systems.

https://preview.redd.it/igtsmgfd40we1.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=46f9469918898ad963dcaab50aa229f2ce8ffdc1

**Dynamic Time Division Duplex (DTDD) for Satellite Networks:** This patent introduces a smart timing controller that manages uplink and downlink signals so they don’t collide when using time-division duplex (TDD) over satellite​. In layman’s terms, because satellites are far away, signals take longer to travel – this system dynamically adjusts when a phone should send vs. receive so that echoes of a transmission don’t interfere with new data. For ASTS, this technology is crucial: it lets standard mobile phones communicate seamlessly with satellites by fine-tuning timing, which improves network reliability and throughput. Without this patent the time between uplink and downlink would result in loss of signal as normal cell signals are not used to the latency experienced in space travel.

**Geolocation of Devices Using Spaceborne Phased Arrays:** This patent outlines a method for pinpointing a phone’s location from space using the satellite’s phased-array antenna​. The satellite first uses its multiple beams to get a rough location (which cell or area the device is in), then refines the device’s position by analyzing Doppler shifts and signal travel time. The satellite can not only talk to your phone but also figure out where you are by how your signal frequency changes (due to motion) and delays, similar to how GPS works but using the communication signal itself.

**Direct GSM Communication via Satellite:** This patent covers a solution that allows standard GSM mobile phones (2G phones) to connect directly to a satellite​. The system involves a satellite with a coverage area divided into cells and a ground infrastructure that includes a feeder link and tracking antenna to manage the connection. A primary processing device communicates with the active users’ phones, and a secondary processor adjusts timing delays for all the beams/cells. This tricks the GSM phones into thinking the satellite is just another cell tower by handling the long signal delay.

https://preview.redd.it/f8er6l9e40we1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=abca83f58c82d29a8223d56ad0a26db503aecf2e

**Network Access Management for Satellite RAN:** This patent describes a method to efficiently handle when a user device first tries to connect to a satellite-based radio network​. The idea is to use a single wide beam from the satellite to watch for any phone requesting access across a large area of many cells. Once a phone’s request is detected in a particular cell, the system then lights up that cell with a focused beam (and can broadcast necessary signals to other inactive cells as needed). Essentially, the satellite first yells “anyone out there?” over a broad area, and when a phone waves back, the satellite switches to a more targeted conversation with that phone’s sector. This on-demand beam switching is business-critical for ASTS: it conserves power and spectrum by not constantly servicing empty regions, allowing one satellite to cover many cells efficiently. It means the network can support more users over a wide area with fewer satellites, lowering operational costs and improving user experience by quickly granting access when someone pops up in a normally quiet zone.

**Satellite MIMO Communication System:** This patent describes a technique for using multiple antennas on both the satellite (or satellites) and the user side to create a MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) link for data​. In simple terms, the base station on the ground can send out multiple distinct radio streams through different satellite beams or even different satellites to a device that has several antennas. By doing so, the end user (if capable, like modern phones with multiple antennas) can receive parallel data streams, boosting throughput.

**Seamless Beam Handover Between Satellites:** This patent deals with handing off a user’s connection from one low-Earth-orbit satellite to the next to avoid dropped calls or data sessions​. It outlines a system where an area on Earth (cell) that is covered by a setting satellite (one moving out of view) is also in view of a rising satellite. The network uses overlapping beams: one satellite’s beam and then the other’s beam cover the same cell during handover. A processing device orchestrates two communication links and switches the user’s session from the first satellite to the second as the first goes over the horizon.

**Types/Patterns of Innovation**

**Initial Testing**

AST began its journey in 2019 with modest yet creative experiment. Their first satellite, BlueWalker 1 (BW1), placed the components of an everyday cell phone into space as a nanosatellite developed in collaboration with NanoAvionics. Instead of the conventional and costly approach—launching a satellite to communicate with ground-based phones, AST reversed this arrangement. They connected a cell phone in orbit with a specialized ground-based satellite (BlueWalker 2). This unusual yet insightful solution significantly reduced the initial costs of launch deployment, enabling rapid and cost-effective R&D. This approach was innovative both economically and operationally, demonstrating practical, real-world viability of their core concept.

https://preview.redd.it/hkwipmdf40we1.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5c9f53577d14b69f873d75c4a3e98bfd039c361

**Funding and Expansion**

Early on, the company attracted strategic backing from the telecom industry. In 2020, a Series B round of $110 million was led by Vodafone and Japan’s Rakuten, with participation from Samsung, and American Tower signaling broad industry confidence in AST’s direct-to-phone satellite technology. Importantly, during this time these investors did their own due diligence on the business and verified the work up to this point and the business case. Rather than a traditional IPO, ASTS utilized a SPAC merger to go public: in April 2021 it merged with New Providence Acquisition Corp., raising a total of $462 million in gross proceeds including $230 million from a PIPE investment by Vodafone, Rakuten, and American Tower.

**BlueWalker 3 Satellite**

With SPAC funding secured, ASTS increased their R&D spend to launch a fully functional satellite, BlueWalker 3 (BW3), featuring the largest phased-array antenna ever deployed in space (save for the international space station). The satellite was approximately 700 sq ft, roughly the size of a one-bedroom apartment. BW3 employed Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), enabling in-orbit software upgrades and flexible testing to allow changes not captured with BW1 to be complete after launch. Successful demonstrations of BW3's capability included groundbreaking tests such as the first-ever 5G video call from space to an everyday smartphone in Hawaii, validating their ability to deliver advanced broadband connectivity directly from orbit.

**BlueBird Block 1**

In September 2024, AST took critical steps toward commercialization with the launch of their first commercial satellites BlueBirds 1 through 5 (Space.com). These satellites further tested vital functionalities, including seamless handoffs between satellites, a key requirement for global continuous connectivity. These launches were strategically significant, marking the transition from proof-of-concept to scalable commercial operations. Demonstration video calls were conducted and announced through MNO partners Vodafone, AT&T, and Verizon for testing AST’s technology in real-world networks. These tests were the result of the FCC granting a Special Temporary Authority (STA) to the company. This was particularly significant given its alignment with the broader regulatory landscape under the new FCC commissioner Brendan Carr (Trump Appointed) which shows the regulatory and market acceptance of AST's innovative business model. Further, this removed the Elon Musk sized elephant in the room wherein Starlink was thought to be the only satellite gaining the approval under the new administration.

https://preview.redd.it/eug6ardg40we1.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ae60b0b69faf8b96915df1273f762cef6232861

**Next-Generation ASICs**

AST is also innovating on hardware performance through development of next-generation Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). Replacing initial FPGA implementations, these ASIC chips promise a 100x increase in data throughput (as in total data deliverable). This dramatic efficiency improvement increases future satellite capabilities and economic performance, making their network even more attractive for commercial deployment.

**Next-Generation Satellites**

AST’s innovation continues with BlueBird 2 (BB2), a significantly scaled-up satellite design of 2,400 sq ft. Incorporating next-gen ASIC technology, these satellites represent a major leap forward in performance and capability, scheduled to be launched through agreements with Blue Origin, ISRO, and SpaceX. Through increased size and performance from the ASIC, ASTS intends to increase the 30mbps download speed represented by Block 1 to 120 mbps in future iterations of their technology. By the end of 2026, AST aims to have a constellation of approximately 60 satellites in orbit, bolstered by substantial financial backing with over $1 billion in available capital.

**Strategic Spectrum Acquisition**

See above Ligado. At character limit.

**Military and Government Partnerships**

Recognizing strategic opportunities, AST has advanced their military use cases, positioning its technology as a solution for the U.S. Department of Defense and Space Development Agency (SDA). With their satellite constellation able to integrate seamlessly with existing military satellite communication (MILSATCOM) infrastructure AST becomes highly relevant for sensitive government applications such as missile tracking, asset monitoring, and secure communications. A recent $43 million SDA contract further highlights AST’s alignment with national security interests and confirms their technology’s strategic importance.

*As part of the U.S. Space Force, SDA will accelerate delivery of needed space-based capabilities to the joint warfighter to support terrestrial missions through development, fielding, and operation of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.*

**Definition of “Value-added” for the Firm’s Products/Services**

**Resilience in Disaster Response**

One of the most compelling advantages of a space-based cellular network is its resilience during disasters. When hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, or other natural disasters strike, terrestrial infrastructure often fails. Cell towers can be knocked out by storms or burned in wildfires, leaving first responders and affected communities without communication exactly when it’s most needed. ASTS satellite technology adds a crucial layer of redundancy: even if ground towers are down, the network in the sky and a single base station anywhere in the country remains operational. This capability can be life-saving in emergency scenarios.

ASTS has been working closely with AT&T to integrate its system with FirstNet, the dedicated U.S. public safety network for first responders. FirstNet, built by AT&T, provides priority cellular service to police, firefighters, EMTs and other emergency personnel. By extending FirstNet into space, ASTS ensures that first responders stay connected in real time, anywhere. The value added by ASTS in disaster response is clear: persistent coverage when conventional networks fail.

**Cost Efficiency Compared to Subsea Cables**

Building out global internet connectivity has traditionally meant expensive infrastructure projects, such as undersea fiber-optic cables to connect continents. These projects involve enormous capital expenditures and long deployment timelines. ASTS' approach – launching a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites – presents a potentially more flexible and cost-efficient path to worldwide broadband coverage. A rough cost comparison highlights this difference in strategy and scalability. ASTS plans to deploy a complete constellation of 168 satellites to achieve global coverage. Each satellite in AST’s “BlueBird” series is estimated to cost on the order of $20 million to build and launch.

*Brian Graft, Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Anything on the cost per satellite? Has that changed at all? Are you still in that $19,000,000 to $21,000,000 range? Abel Avellan: No. Yes, we’re not changing the guidance on cost per satellite*

https://preview.redd.it/ekodb1pi40we1.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=03caa476262231e043b928ceacdee51a854d05d0

It’s important to note that satellite broadband isn’t a wholesale replacement for fiber in terms of raw capacity – major cables can carry tremendous data volume at very low latency along their fixed routes, which is vital for the core internet backbone. However, from a business strategy perspective, ASTS' satellites offer a more economical way to extend the “last mile” of connectivity to users who would otherwise require huge investment to reach.

**Enabling Always-On Connectivity for Emerging Technologies**

Beyond simply connecting people, ASTS' continuous global coverage unlocks critical opportunities for emerging technologies that depend on uninterrupted internet access. For AI agents and cloud services, constant connectivity is essential. Autonomous robotics, including self-driving cars, drones, and agricultural robots, similarly benefit from AST’s satellite service, ensuring seamless operation even in remote areas beyond traditional cellular coverage.

NomadBets twitter shows the breakdown of subscriber potential with ASTS. This is where revenue will blow out all expectations.

ASTS competencies are built around its ability to design, manufacture, and deploy large and powerful satellites optimized for direct-to-device (D2D) connectivity. All of which are critical for maximizing signal strength, bandwidth, and data throughput directly to everyday smartphones. AST's expertise in large arrays is particularly advantageous, as bigger (and thereby heavier) arrays translate directly into stronger signals, increased power generation, and significantly improved data speeds to user devices. ASTS requires just 168 large satellites for global coverage, compared to 3,236 for Amazon's Kuiper and over 8,158 for SpaceX's Starlink, this greatly reduces CAPEX, collision risk, launch risk, and replacement costs for AST. With all this in mind, AST benefits greatly from falling launch costs enabled by leading space-launch providers such as Blue Origin and SpaceX. This is best displayed as a year-over-year pricing trend of launch vehicles on a per-kilogram basis:

https://preview.redd.it/4czj2u8q40we1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1dc9937bf0e7f1da432fb69857d50618053670

As launch providers increasingly offer higher-capacity rockets at reduced costs, ASTS uniquely benefits from its strategy of deploying fewer, heavier satellites with large, high-performance antennas rather than numerous smaller satellites. The first successful flight of Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket notably demonstrated its capability to carry up to eight of AST’s Block 2 satellites simultaneously, providing a clear cost advantage. Likewise, SpaceX’s Falcon 9, recognized globally for its reliability and affordability, can accommodate four Block 2 satellites per launch. Additionally, the progress on SpaceX’s Starship program offers further promise, potentially unlocking even greater launch capacities at lower costs.

AST's operational competencies are further strengthened by its vertical integration.

*Approximately 95% vertically integrated for manufacturing of satellite components and subsystems, for which we own or license the IP and control the manufacturing process*.

By controlling its own production processes and intellectual property, AST not only reduces dependency on external suppliers—mitigating geopolitical and supply-chain risks—but also achieves superior cost efficiencies and quality control. This vertical integration is crucial at a time when the United States is prioritizing domestic capability in strategic industries like space technology, positioning AST favorably to benefit from increasing governmental support and protective policies.

The company's production strategy is robust and ambitious, with AST targeting a monthly production rate of six satellites at its Texas factory. This consistent cadence enables rapid scaling and timely replacement of satellites, ensuring continuous, reliable service for customers. Given rising geopolitical tensions, particularly concerning competition with China in space exploration and technology, AST's fully integrated, U.S.-based manufacturing operation places it strategically to capitalize on potential government partnerships or contracts aimed at strengthening domestic space capabilities.

Here is all you need to know: the CEO Abel Avellan is a certified bad ass. He has had a successful exit from his first company EMC and used that cash to fund this company. He takes no salary, he doesn’t have a crazy stock based compensation that he extracts with, he is just a good dude who is aligned with the company and its investors. He doesn’t spend his day on twitter trying to impregnate Tiffany Fong. He has not lied about his ability to play Diablo or PoE2. We like Abel. You should too.

Reposting in hopes of re-sparking the discussion on this-- obviously with Trump pausing all tariffs except for China and the dip being bought, it looks like what I said would happen happened.**

**However, phase 2 is just beginning.**

DISCLAIMER: I THINK THEIR PLANS ARE 100% DISTILLED ORGANIC REGARDIUM. HOWEVER, THESE PLANS EXIST; IT ISN'T JUST THE DEATH THROES OF A DEMENTED OLD MAN. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GOALS AND HOW THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE THEM, SO YOU DON'T GET WIPED OUT BY A SINGULAR MANIAC'S AMBITIONS.

  
“I believe very strongly in tariffs. America is being ripped off. We’re a debtor nation, and we have to tax, we have to tariff, we have to protect this country.”

\--Donald Trump, 1988



[Transshipment](https://china.ucsd.edu/_files/02072025-brief-identify-tariff-evasion-web.pdf) is how China bypasses US trade restrictions-- the idea is simple, just ship to an intermediate country in southeast Asia or Mexico before shipping to the United States. Since the entire goal is to evade detection, it's impossible to get direct numbers on how much Chinese originating volume comes into the U.S. in this manner, but it's estimated to be at the very least tens of billions of dollars in goods per year.

This has also been [top-of-mind from Trump's current administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/industry-lawmakers-applaud-president-trumps-section-232-tariffs/), with realizations that the 2018 trade war did not go to the extent of their real goals because of ""loopholes"" and negotiation failures. So, this time around, the goal is the same-- a trade war with China, but the entire world has become collateral damage.

Their goals behind the trade war with China hasn't drastically changed from 2018:

* [Coward Nutlick has repeatedly hinted that ""deindustrialization is a national security risk"".](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-on-face-the-nation-with-margaret-brennan-april-6-2025/) In layman's terms, if a war ever broke out, [China would be able to pump out missiles and weapons at a faster pace.](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA787225532&sid=sitemap&v=2.1&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7E3a357c28&aty=open-web-entry) Peter Navarro has said that ""every time you buy a good made in China, you are financing their navy in the Taiwan strait."" His book Death by China (2011) also details how we are dependent on their supply chains for medical supplies, electronics, and weapons.
* Miran, senior economic advisor to Trump: [trade deficits are economic dependence.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/cea-chairman-steve-miran-hudson-institute-event-remarks/) True at face value, but the dependency goes both ways. As with the fundamental theory of trading and competitive advantage goes, both sides win. U.S. industry is built off the back of Chinese supply and labor, and the Chinese have become wealthy off of the largest consumer market in the world.

So, the plan that would somewhat explain their intentions behind tariffing the world is to get other countries to come to the table, fence-off Chinese transshipping, and/or strike deals that cut off Chinese suppliers to third party countries as well. This would explain why they imposed tariffs on penguin-inhabited islands such as [Heard and McDonald Island](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/revealed-how-trump-tariffs-slugged-norfolk-island-and-uninhabited-heard-and-mcdonald-islands)\-- closing off loopholes. They want to hurt China while hurting ourselves, but think that we can withstand the pain more than they can. It's unclear as to whether they're right, or if this game is even worth playing, but it's definitely *a plan, even if it's a bad one,* which is better for the market than having no narrative or confidence.

What does this mean in the short term? Trump has no intention to keep unjustifiably high tariffs on everyone else *besides China.* As deals are struck, either side capitulates, it becomes clear that ""liberation day"" was just a second attempt at 2018 U.S. vs. China, which, to investors, is at least preferable to U.S. vs. The World (for seemingly no reason). With a narrative to cling onto and a return to (relative) normalcy, the markets can go up in the short term because of a universal instinct to ""buy the dip."" The markets no longer have reason to freefall panic that a literal maniac is driving the world economy to ruin; he at least has a plan, if not a half-baked one.

**\^ this was posted on 2025-04-08 2:12PM ET.**

**""TRUMP HAS NO INTENTION TO KEEP UNJUSTIFIABLY HIGH TARIFFS ON EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES CHINA"" --me**

**""THE MARKETS CAN GO UP IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF A UNIVERSAL INSTINCT TO BUY THE DIP"" --me**

**""TO INVESTORS, U.S. VS. CHINA IS PREFERABLE TO U.S. VS. THE WORLD"" --me**

However, as the initial panic subsides, the ramifications of ""reducing the trade deficit with China"" will set in. Numbers like earnings, inflation, consumer spending, and GDP growth will bleed. Eventually unemployment, defaults, and bankruptcies will follow, putting the Fed in an unwinnable situation. The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and ""reindustrialize"" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028.

tl;dr: Since the goal is to ""Reduce the trade deficit with China,"" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression.

**UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA**

I think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it.

Who are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray...

Navarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is ""ripping off the world."" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization.

Are these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple:

**Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to ""decouple"" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.**

**He believes in ""short term pain,"" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the ""dependency"" on China.**

Simply put:

AAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS.

However, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the ""apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip"" reflex continues over the rest of the week.

Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.

* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated
* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

It’s been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO Elon Musk spending much of his time in President Donald Trump’s White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president’s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.

Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

In its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that “uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.” The company said this “dynamic,” and “changing political sentiment” could have a meaningful near-term impact on demand for its products.

Tesla has faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe, where Musk has actively supported Germany’s far-right AfD party. Earlier this month, the company reported a 13% decline in first quarter deliveries from a year earlier to 336,681.

Tesla has been struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by Alphabet’s Waymo. The company has promised to launch its first driverless ride-hailing offering in Austin, Texas, in June.

The company reassured investors on Tuesday that it remains on track for a “pilot launch” in Austin by that point, and to begin building its humanoid robots on a pilot production line in Fremont, California, this year.

Operating income in the quarter slid 66% to $400 million from $1.17 billion a year earlier, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. The company cited an increase in expenses tied to artificial intelligence projects as one factor in the decline.

The company would have lost money on automotive sales without environmental regulatory credits during the quarter. Revenue from the credits, which Tesla receives for selling fully electric vehicles, increased to $595 million from $432 million in the same quarter last year.

Energy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% in the quarter to $2.73 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago. The company said growth in AI infrastructure is “creating an outsized opportunity for our Energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.”

Tesla uses foreign suppliers for its energy business. The company said “increasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near-term impacts to supply and demand.”

#Trump’s Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants

###Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the US. But cutting ties won’t be easy.

> The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.

> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.

> “There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.

> The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.”

> Two European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks—with some already starting to make the jump. Multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems.

> “We have more demand from across Europe,” says Mathias Nöbauer, the CEO of Swiss-based hosting provider Exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. “Some customers were very explicit,” Nöbauer says. “Especially customers from Denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from US hyperscalers because of the US administration and what they said about Greenland.”

> “It's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. And from the Europeans’ perspective—that the US is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,” says Joakim Öhman, the CEO of Swedish cloud provider Elastx. “Those are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.”

> Concerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the EU and US, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people’s rights. Multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by European courts. At the end of January, Trump fired three Democrats from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which helps manage the current agreement. The move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. In addition, Öhman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the CLOUD Act, which can allow US law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the US.

> Dave Cottlehuber, the founder of SkunkWerks, a small tech infrastructure firm in Austria, says he has been moving the company’s few servers and databases away from US providers to European services since the start of the year. “First and foremost, it’s about values,” Cottlehuber says. “For me, privacy is a right not a privilege.” Cottlehuber says the decision to move is easier for a small business such as his, but he argues it removes some taxes that are paid to the Trump administration. “The best thing I can do is to remove that small contribution of mine, and also at the same time, make sure that my customers’ privacy is respected and preserved,” Cottlehuber says.

> Steffen Schmidt, the CEO of Medicusdata, a company that provides text-to-speech services to doctors and hospitals in Europe, says that having data in Europe has always “been a must,” but his customers have been asking for more in recent weeks. “Since the beginning of 2025, in addition to data residency guarantees, customers have actively asked us to use cloud providers that are natively European companies,” Schmidt says, adding that some of his services have been moved to Nöbauer’s Exoscale.

> Harry Staight, a spokesperson for AWS, says it is “not accurate” that customers are moving from AWS to EU alternatives. “Our customers have control over where they store their data and how it is encrypted, and we make the AWS Cloud sovereign-by-design,” Straight says. “AWS services support encryption with customer managed keys that are inaccessible to AWS, which means customers have complete control of who accesses their data.” Staight says the membership of the PCLOB “does not impact” the agreements around EU-US data sharing and that the CLOUD Act has “additional safeguards for cloud content.” Google and Microsoft declined to comment.

> The potential shift away from US tech firms is not just linked to cloud providers. Since January 15, visitors to the European Alternatives website increased more than 1,200 percent. The site lists everything from music streaming services to DDoS protection tools, says Marko Saric, a cofounder of European cloud analytics service Plausible. “We can certainly feel that something is going on,” Saric says, claiming that during the first 18 days of March the company has “beaten” the net recurring revenue growth it saw in January and February. “This is organic growth which cannot be explained by any seasonality or our activities,” he says.

> While there are signs of movement, the impact is likely to be small—at least for now. Around the world, governments and businesses use multiple cloud services—such as authentication measures, hosting, data storage, and increasingly data centers providing AI processing—from the big three cloud and tech service providers. Cottlehuber says that, for large businesses, it may take many months, if not longer, to consider what needs to be moved, the risks involved, plus actually changing systems. “What happens if you have a hundred petabytes of storage, it's going to take years to move over the internet,” he says.

> For years, European companies have struggled to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon’s cloud services and technical infrastructure, which make billions every year. It may also be difficult to find similar services on the scale of those provided by alternative European cloud firms.

> “If you are deep into the hyperscaler cloud ecosystem, you’ll struggle to find equivalent services elsewhere,” says Bert Hubert, an entrepreneur and former government regulator, who says he has heard of multiple new cloud migrations to US firms being put on hold or reconsidered. Hubert has argued that it is no longer “safe” for European governments to be moved to US clouds and that European alternatives can’t properly compete. “We sell a lot of fine wood here in Europe. But not that much furniture,” he says. However, that too could change.

> Schaake, the former member of the European Parliament, says a combination of new investments, a different approach to buying public services, and a Europe-first approach or investing in a European technology stack could help to stimulate any wider moves on the continent. “The dramatic shift of the Trump administration is very tangible,” Schaake says. “The idea that anything could happen and that Europe should fend for itself is clear. Now we need to see the same kind of pace and leadership that we see with defense to actually turn this into meaningful action.”

>Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s ‘all-in’ gamble to get Donald Trump elected president has proven so successful that a veritable chasm has opened up between his EV manufacturer and the rest of the auto industry. As conventional carmakers trade at rock-bottom prices amid a broad industry malaise brought on by China’s economic slowdown and growing fears of Trump tariffs, Tesla’s stock continues to soar, creating one of the biggest valuation gaps it’s ever seen.

(Reuters) - Tesla faces a proposed class action claiming it speeds up odometers on its electric vehicles so they fall out of warranty faster, saving Elon Musk's company from having to pay for repairs.

The plaintiff Nyree Hinton alleged that Tesla odometer readings reflect energy consumption, driver behavior and ""predictive algorithms"" rather than actual mileage driven.

He said the odometer on the 2020 Model Y he bought in December 2022 with 36,772 miles on the clock ran at least 15% fast, based on his other vehicles and driving history, and for a while said he drove 72 miles a day when at most he drove 20.

Hinton, a Los Angeles resident, said this caused his 50,000-mile basic warranty to expire well ahead of schedule, leaving him with a $10,000 suspension repair bill that he thought Tesla should cover.

""By tying warranty limits and lease mileage caps to inflated 'odometer' readings, Tesla increases repair revenue, reduces warranty obligations, and compels consumers to purchase extended warranties prematurely,"" the complaint said.

Tesla and its lawyer did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment, but have denied all material allegations in the lawsuit. The Austin, Texas-based company does not have a media relations office.

Hinton is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for Tesla drivers in California, potentially encompassing more than 1 million vehicles, court papers show.

Tesla moved his lawsuit this month to Los Angeles federal court from a state court in that city.

The automaker has also faced litigation accusing it of inflating vehicle driving ranges.

In March 2024, a federal judge in Oakland, California said drivers in that case must pursue their claims in individual arbitrations, not a class action.

The case is Hinton v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 25-02877.",8737

We might also see some volatility tomorrow at the open, VIX has already spiked but went back to preannouncement levels.

~~EDIT: TARIFFS ARE DELAYED UNTIL MARCH 1ST~~

# [EDIT 2: ANNOUNCEMENT OF TARIFF DELAY HAS BEEN DEBUNKED, STILL CONTINUING ON SATURDAY ACCORDING TO WH PRESS SECRETARY ](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/north-america-braces-new-trump-tariffs-saturday-deadline-nears-2025-01-31/)

>President Donald Trump President Donald Trump said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

>“We’ll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,” Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision.

>“Number one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we’re giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,” he said.

>West Texas Intermediate oil futures climbed above $73 a barrel following the comments. The US dollar wiped out an earlier loss to touch the day’s high after the remarks, while the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both plunged. US Treasuries pared their gains.

>Trump indicated the 25% rate could represent a floor, saying that the tariff levels “may or may not rise with time.”

>But the US president did suggest he was still considering if one significant import — oil — would be exempted. Trump said would be making a determination as soon as Thursday evening, basing his decision upon the price of oil.

>“We don’t need the products that they have. We have all the oil that you need. We have all the trees you need,” Trump added, referring to major imports from Canada.

>Trump’s move was closely anticipated by markets as well as global business and political leaders who have scrutinized his words and actions for any indication on whether the US president would deliver on his levy threats or use them as the starting point for negotiations on trade.

>Trump in recent days threatened and then pulled back on tariffs against Colombia in a dispute over deportations of undocumented migrants, leading some to speculate that he was using trade levies merely as leverage to seek policy concessions.

>Trump also indicated that he would proceed with tariffs on China. He didn’t specify the levy, though he’s previously said it would be 10%. Trump has said Beijing failed to follow through on promises to prevent fentanyl and the chemicals used to make the deadly drugs from flowing into the US.

>“With China, I’m also thinking about something because they’re sending fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they’re causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths,” Trump said Thursday. “So China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we’re in the process of doing that.”

>Trump has ordered his administration to investigate whether China complied with a trade deal struck during his first term, setting the stage for tariffs against the world’s second largest economy.

>Following through on tariffs against Canada and Mexico, who are US neighbors, major trading partners, and export markets, threatens to have dramatic economic consequences, rattle markets and potentially launch a trade war by undermining protections from a three-nation free trade agreement.

>Both countries have pledged to respond to any trade levies, including with retaliatory tariffs, even as their leaders sought to assure the US they were addressing border concerns in a bid to defuse the conflict.

>“If these tariffs go into effect, Canada will respond,” Canadian Ambassador to the US Kirsten Hillman said Thursday. “This is not something that we want to do. We do not want to get into a tariff-back-and-forth with the United States. It’s not good for Canada, Canadians and Canadian workers and it’s not good for the United States, Americans and American workers.”

>Hillman said that Canada has responded to Trump’s concerns about the border by clamping down and announcing new security measures, including added drones and helicopters.

>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort even before the president was inaugurated in a bid to ease tensions between their nations, and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke to Trump to try to avert the levies.

>In the first 11 months of 2024, US trade with Canada totaled $699 billion and $776 billion with Mexico. And the magnitude of tariffs Trump will enact could have stark impacts on particular industries, such as the auto industry and the energy sector. Shares of US automakers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. turned negative on the announcement, erasing earlier gains.

>“President Trump’s tariffs will tax America first,” Matthew Holmes, executive vice president at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday. “From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose.”

>Trump is also promising sectoral tariffs, such as on pharmaceuticals, semiconductor chips, steel, aluminum and copper, which could apply widely to many countries, including Canada and Mexico.

>The US president is an avowed believer in tariffs, saying they will force a renaissance in domestic manufacturing, though industry groups warn that it will upend supply chains and endanger existing factories by raising costs of source materials.

>He’s hailed tariffs as a source of revenue as lawmakers move to renew and expand expiring tax cuts and approve other credits and benefits the president promised on the campaign trail. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate to 15% for firms that manufacture goods in the US, compared to the current 21% rate.said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

> Elon Musk’s net worth has reached $400 billion, according to Bloomberg, making him the first person ever to cross that mark. Behind his nearly $20 billion jump in wealth was a deal that shot up Musk’s rocket company SpaceX’s valuation to roughly $350 billion, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. SpaceX and its investors agreed to purchase as much as $1.25 billion of insider shares. Tesla shares closed at a record high on Wednesday, hitting $424.77 at market close. Musk, who is Tesla’s largest individual shareholder, has also enjoyed the stock propelling higher in part due to the broader market — NASDAQ topped 20,000 for the first time ever Wednesday. Since Election Day, the EV maker’s stock has rallied roughly 65% on investors’ belief that Musk’s influence in the Trump administration will usher in an era of deregulation that will benefit the company.

> His artificial intelligence startup, xAI, also more than doubled in value in November amid a new funding round, surging to $50 billion from a few months ago, according to the Wall Street Journal. The world’s wealthiest man is now roughly $136 billion richer since November 5, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. While the top spots on the billionaires index typically switch around, Musk is racing past his wealthy peers. As of December 10, before his wealth skyrocketed to $400 billion, he was already $140 billion richer than the second-richest man on Earth, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

In total, 85% of the 245 participants polled by the firm believe Musk’s foray into politics has either had a “negative” or “extremely negative” impact on business fundamentals. The majority of respondents also expect Tesla deliveries to fall this year, according to the survey.

While a small sampling, these results offer the latest sign of mounting frustration with the billionaire entrepreneur as he’s become a rising figure in international and American politics. It also comes at a pivotal point for Tesla’s stock, with shares plunging nearly 40% this year.

When asked about Musk’s efforts with U.S. government efficiency and other political activities, 45% of respondents said these actions had a “negative” effect on the company. Another 40% said they were having an “extremely negative” impact.

On the other hand, 3% said they were “positive” for the business. Meanwhile, 12% called them “insignificant.”

To be sure, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reported that his survey respondents are drawn from his email distribution list and should not be taken as a random representative sample. He also noted that the respondents are not necessarily owners of Tesla stock. The survey was taken over a 17-hour period, starting on Tuesday afternoon.

Jonas also asked about expectations for the company’s performance. In a separate question, 59% said they anticipated Tesla would deliver fewer cars to customers in 2025 compared with the prior year. What’s more, 21% of total respondents said they expected a decline of more than 10%. That comes as some analysts have raised alarm that recent reports of vandalism could spook potential customers.

Just 19% of responders said they forecasted deliveries to rise in 2025, while another 23% said they would be flat between the two years.

Musk’s political profile has grown after his public support of President Donald Trump in the runup up to last year’s election and his subsequent role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla executive’s efforts to slash the federal government’s spending and workforce has drawn the ire of critics who see his team as working too quickly and haphazardly.

Musk acknowledged in an interview with Fox Business on Monday that his high-profile role in Trump’s administration meant he was running his businesses, which also include X and SpaceX, “with great difficulty.” That day, Tesla shares tumbled more than 15% for their worst session since 2020.

Despite the recent nosedive, 45% of respondents said they anticipate Tesla shares will be at least 11% higher by the end of the calendar year. Around 36% expect the stock to tumble another 11% or further by year-end, while 19% see the stock staying within 10% of its price around $220.

After a New York Times report last week unearthed criticisms of Musk’s team from members of Trump’s cabinet, the president offered a vote of confidence on Tuesday. Trump evaluated five Tesla models parked at the White House after the president said on social media that he would buy one as a symbol of support.

Trump also said he would declare violence at Tesla dealerships to be acts of domestic terrorism.

1octyv8,2025-10-22 02:34:04,Reddit,stocks,TSLA,Take Back Tesla campaign urges shareholders to reject Musk $1 trillion pay plan,"A day ahead of Tesla’s quarterly earnings report, a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs wants investors to focus their attention on matters of governance.

On Tuesday, a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers and Public Citizen launched a website for Take Back Tesla, a campaign urging shareholders to vote against a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that would net him nearly $1 trillion worth of stock and expand his control over the company.

Tesla’s board floated the pay proposal in September, saying the largest ever CEO pay plan was appropriate and necessary to lock Musk in for a decade. The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.

On the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.

The site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.

“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”

Additional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.

Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Top proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion pay plan, which was disclosed amid a tense battle over Musk’s previous 2018 pay package, which amounted to about $56 billion in stock when it vested.

Following those firms’ suggestions, Tesla wrote in a post that, “ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against Tesla’s proposals time and time again since the 2018 CEO Performance Award was introduced.” The company added that shareholders who sold would “have missed out on our market capitalization soaring by 20x from March 2018 to August 2025.”

The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 plan was improperly granted by Tesla, with the judge finding that the company hid crucial details from shareholders and that Musk had controlled board members rather than negotiating with them for a fair deal.

Musk appealed the matter to the Delaware State Supreme Court and is seeking to get the 2018 CEO pay package reinstated.

Around the time that plan was rescinded, in January 2024, Musk wrote on his social network X, “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having \~25% voting control.” The new plan would add 12% to his stake over the next decade.

Musk had already started artificial intelligence startup xAI in March 2023, taking some ex-Tesla employees with him, and was developing Grok, a would-be challenger to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

By May 2025, Musk said he was committed to running Tesla for at least five more years.

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees a $300 billion pension fund, said he “vociferously opposes this pay package” and says other public fiduciaries should do the same.

“Most of the time we’ve held Tesla stock, it has been a solid investment, it’s grown over time, and that’s why we haven’t chosen to dump it,” Lander, who also serves as finance and accountability chief for the city, said in an interview. Lander said that he’s preferred to “hold on to it and participate in shareholder engagement to address the concerns we have.”

Lander manages funds that own about $1.1 billion worth of Tesla, based on holdings reported in August.

He said he views Tesla’s board he as “insufficiently independent,” and that it’s allowed Musk to be an “absentee CEO.” The company has also failed to hit its marks when it comes to robotaxis and self-driving technology, Lander said.

The stock has rallied of late after a brutal start to the year, but it’s still underperforming its tech peers and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in 2025.

Musk has “been an inconsistent CEO at best,” Lander said, “and the pay package is like a ransom attempt after volatile stock performance and destroying consumer confidence.”

Tesla is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the close of regular trading on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting revenue growth of 4.7% from a year earlier to $26.37 billion, according to LSEG, following two straight year-over-year declines.

Recently disclosed text messages reveal that Elon Musk tried to sway Norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund—commonly known as the Oil Fund—to support his controversial Tesla pay package. The fund, which manages assets of around USD 1.8 trillion and holds a significant stake in Tesla, voted against Musk’s compensation proposal, prompting him to admonish CEO Nicolai Tangen not to request any “favors” until making amends.

In their exchange, Musk also accused Tangen of leaking the texts to the media, after Norwegian outlets reported on his canceled dinner appearance at the Oil Fund’s investment conference. Tangen countered that Norway’s strict transparency laws, akin to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, required partial disclosure, including confirmation that Musk would not attend.

Initially, the Oil Fund classified much of the conversation as private and withheld it. However, in the spirit of transparency, they eventually released all texts. The incident highlights the tension between Musk’s calls for discretion and the Norwegian Oil Fund’s legal obligations to remain open. While emphasizing a positive relationship with Tesla as a critical investment, the fund has reiterated its opposition to Musk’s pay plan.",3389
1ik4nfq,2025-02-07 21:21:19,Reddit,stocks,TSLA,Chinese Markets are Rejecting Tesla,"Tesla’s dominance in the EV market is slipping, and nowhere is that more obvious than in China. According to a new report from CNBC, Tesla’s sales in China dropped 11.5% this January compared to the same time last year. With China setting the pace for the global EV industry, Tesla is rapidly losing ground to local giants like BYD.

It’s not just a sales dip, it’s a wipeout. In January, BYD sold 30% more EVs than Tesla worldwide. The reason? Cost and variety.

While Tesla leans on price cuts to compete, Chinese brands like BYD are already priced lower from the start. Tesla’s profit margins, once its strong suit, are shrinking fast, while BYD keeps scaling production without sacrificing profitability. The Model 3 and Model Y Tesla’s core models are struggling to hold their own against a flood of cheaper, high-tech, government-backed alternatives.

For years, Tesla thrived under China’s policies that welcomed foreign EV makers. That era is over. The Chinese government has made it clear, they want their own brands to lead the global EV race. Companies like BYD, Nio, and XPeng are now the priority, while Tesla is increasingly seen as an outsider.

Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory, once a strategic advantage, is now a vulnerability. The Chinese government could tighten regulations, cut subsidies, or tilt the playing field even further in favor of domestic competitors, any of which would weaken Tesla’s foothold even more.

Elon’s strategy of constant price cuts has helped sustain demand, but the latest 11.5% sales drop suggests the approach is losing its effectiveness. Cutting prices again and again doesn’t build brand loyalty.. It signals that demand is slipping.

And Tesla can’t keep squeezing its margins forever. The competition isn’t slowing down it’s accelerating.",3345
1jo91nk,2025-03-31 19:37:52,Reddit,stocks,TSLA,Elon Musk says backlash against his DOGE government cuts is hurting Tesla stock,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Sunday that his involvement in the Trump administration could be hurting the automaker’s stock price.

Speaking at a town hall event in Wisconsin, Musk said his role with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency — which is pushing for widespread government job cuts — is creating backlash against his electric car company and hurting the stock.

“What they’re trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to ... stop doing this,” Musk said, according to Bloomberg News. “My Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean it’s a big deal.”

Shares of Tesla entered Monday already down more than 34% year to date, and the stock has been cut nearly in half from its peak in December. Shares were down an additional 6% in premarket trading Monday.

The drop for the stock could be a “buying opportunity” for the long term, said Musk, who was in Wisconsin ahead of a state supreme court election there. Musk has campaigned for the conservative candidate and spent more than $12 million on the race, in addition to giving $1 million each to two voters at Sunday’s rally for signing a petition against “activist judges.”

The slumping stock isn’t the only sign of public anger with Musk for his political work. Protesters demonstrated at Tesla dealerships over the weekend, and there have been reports of vandalism against vehicles and dealers across the country.

Musk’s role in politics is not limited to DOGE. He publicly campaigned with Trump in 2024 and has been a regular presence at the White House since the new administration took over in January. He also regularly comments on many different political topics on X, the social media company he owns.

The CEO’s rising political profile comes amid signs that Tesla’s core business is slowing. The automaker’s vehicle deliveries declined in 2024, and preliminary data has shown that sales are down again early this year, especially in Europe. In a note to clients Sunday, investment firm Stifel trimmed its price target on the stock and lowered its sales projections for Tesla.

Musk’s political dealings may not be the only reason for Tesla’s struggles. Other U.S. auto stocks have also labored in recent weeks, partly because of threats of higher tariffs on imported goods into the U.S. and retaliation from overseas trading partners, adding uncertainty to an industry whose supply chains are tightly woven among the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Norway can be a reference for other markets in the future but only if Tesla is able to clean up their reputation.

Since administration only started on the 21st, we will only see the real effect of decline in sales when numbers from March are published. Some other countries share car registrations which are from a time point a view much more reliable than sales, since it's unclear if this is about cars being delivered or ordered.

**Reasons of decline**

* (stronger) competition
* oversaturation of Tesla, people want to have another car as the rest
* customers possibly waiting for new Tesla Y 
* Musk

Although oversaturation is less of a risk in other countries, people still steer away from Tesla in favour of different, fresher designs. Tesla is focusing a lot on new tech gadgets/software, while their cars still almost look the same as many years ago.

**Conclusion and near future**

Although it's unclear if the numbers are deliveries or orders in February, we might see a further decline. People that  already decided to buy a Tesla are unlikely to cancel their order. In Norway we might see almost no sales anymore because until new Tesla Y rolls out. In other countries sales could plunge the same as in Norway.

If the decline of sales becomes a trend this will in the short term become a big logistic and manufactoring problem for Tesla. They'll have to start dealing with overstock, production might need to be halted since more production might just lead to more overstock.",3136

1ji0n3r,2025-03-23 15:35:01,Reddit,stocks,TSLA,"Tariffs, DOGE and Columbia — The market will crash because Trumpism is not capitalism","There is a lot of talk, in this subreddit and just about everywhere, about how the tariffs are going to affect stock prices. I think the bigger factor is that Trumpism is not capitalism. This government has asserted its right to cancel contracts and grants, and the right to use all means at its disposal to impose policy on non-government entities. One example: NIH grants have been canceled because they were interpreted (apparently by someone who probably did not even read them, and certainly doesn’t understand them) as being no longer in line with the priorities of this government. These are multimillion dollar projects on topics like cancer, autism and shingles. They were funded after a careful competitive review by scientists, and they were stopped after much of the money was spent. It’s half-finished bridges. You can no doubt provide many examples yourself. If you can’t, ask in the comments. My point here is that under Trumpism the government will abandon contracts at will, and will use the threat of cancellation to micromanage state and local government, and corporations. 

The cases of Columbia and Maine illustrate that this government has replaced the rule of law with rule by one man. In both cases, Trump asserted the right to dictate policy normally left to the University (regarding the limits of free speech on campus) or to the state (regarding trans-gender athletes), and found ways to enforce that. I don’t yet know of a case where this government directly managed a company, but I’m sure it will come; he has the tools (the threat of cancellation of government contracts, or exemptions from tariffs, to name two). The threat of arbitrary and capricious directives from this government, coupled with the inability to rely on contracts being honored, is going to destroy profits. Milton Friedman, the famed Chicago school economist, argued that democracy, economic freedom and the rule of law are essential for prosperity. We no longer have those things. Let me give you three examples. 

I have significant holdings in MRNA, Moderna. Their mRNA technology allows the rapid development of custom drugs, not only vaccines, but drugs to treat cancer and many other diseases. They demonstrated that they can deliver during the covid-19 pandemic, and many estimates hold that RNA vaccines saved over 10 million lives. This is a great American company, and it should be ascendent, but its stock price is currently beaten down by the reasonable expectation of politically based resistance to mRNA vaccines from the Trump administration. 

TSLA was one of last year’s magnificent seven and rose even higher when Trump was elected because of the expectation that the CEO Elon Musk’s close personal relationship with the president would pay off. Now, it has fallen along with Musk’s popularity. People realize that DOGE found precious little waste and fraud but compromised many valued functions of government. To my point here, the value of TSLA stock is entirely dependent on Trump’s continued favor. If there are many government contracts, it will probably recover. If there is a falling out after Trump finally finds it necessary to blame Musk for the obvious problems with DOGE, then it will not. In either case, this is not a free market. 

Finally, I want to mention Boeing. Trump personally announced on Friday that Boeing had been selected to build the F-47 jet fighter, a contract potentially worth $50 billion. So far so good, but he’s making it clear that he decides. I expect this contract to specify everything from who Boeing can purchase parts from, to DEI policies, to whether someone given the name Charles at birth can go by Chuck. 

Trumpism is government regulation on steroids.   ",2658

Shares of the electric vehicle maker plunged more than 8% on Tuesday, pushing the company’s market cap below $1 trillion and to its lowest since Nov. 7, which was two days after President Donald Trump’s election victory.

The stock has plummeted 25% to start the year, while the Nasdaq is down just 1.5%, and has slid more than 35% from its record close on Dec. 16. CEO Elon Musk has lost more than $100 billion in net worth over that stretch, though he is still the world’s richest person, with a fortune valued at about $380 billion.

The latest slide followed a report from Reuters on Monday that Tesla’s long-awaited upgrade to its partially automated driving systems left owners disappointed. Many users told the publication that Tesla’s “navigate on city streets” feature in China fell short of Musk’s promises for self-driving technology.

Other EV makers in China, including BYD, offer their partially automated driving systems for free or a much lower cost. Xiaomi’s popular model SU7 includes the company’s equivalent technology as a standard option for free.

The report out of China added to anxiety among Tesla shareholders. Some of the concern has to do with the company’s performance and some is specific to Musk, who is spending much of his time in Washington, D.C., leading President Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Musk, along with his team in Washington, has gained unparalleled access to government computer systems and taxpayer data, and the president has enabled the billionaire to lead mass firings of workers in agencies tasked with oversight of his companies, including Tesla.

Musk’s extremist political rhetoric and activism has led opponents in various markets to organize protests, including at Tesla stores and service centers. Tesla’s stock dropped earlier this month on Trump’s announced plans for extensive tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, which came alongside a decline in Tesla vehicle registrations across Europe in January and February.

For the fourth quarter, Tesla reported earnings and sales that missed analysts’ estimates, with automotive revenue dropping 8% from a year earlier and operating income plummeting 23%. In the late January report, the company cited reduced average selling prices across its aging lineup of Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X vehicles as a major reason for the decline.

According to the California New Car Dealers Association, Tesla sales dropped 11.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024 in the state, which had been Tesla’s biggest market domestically.

Tesla shares are now about 20% above where they were trading prior to Trump’s victory. Most of what remains of the rally is due to the stock’s 15% jump the day after the election. Musk was a major backer of Trump’s presidential effort, contributing $290 million to Republican candidates and causes in 2024, with most of that directed at returning Trump to the White House.

1iy5new,2025-02-25 21:58:35,Reddit,stocks,TSLA,Tesla sales in Europe down 45% in January,"Tesla sales plummeted in Europe in January, suggesting waning demand for the US carmaker’s vehicles after its billionaire chief Elon Musk stepped up his high-profile interventions in the region’s politics.

The EV maker sold just 9,900 units in Europe last month, a decline of more than 45 per cent from the same period in 2024, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Its overall share of new car registrations fell to 1 per cent from 1.8 per cent over the same period.

Tesla’s falling market share comes after Musk’s unprecedented foray into EU politics, where he backed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) ahead of the country’s elections, sparking a backlash on the continent. Musk has also railed against the EU, which he described in November as “undemocratic”.

The fall came even as European consumers purchased 166,000 battery EVs for the month, up 37 per cent from a year ago. Pure EV sales grew faster than those of all other types of vehicles, while sales of cars with petrol and diesel engines fell 20.5 per cent and 26.5 per cent, respectively.

The figures include the EU, UK and other markets including Norway, one of Europe’s biggest markets for EVs.

European sales by SAIC Motor, the Chinese state-backed carmaker that has expanded into the EU and partnered with Audi in China, rose 37 per cent to 23,000 vehicles in January, among the largest year-on-year increases in sales of any large manufacturer in the region.

Overall new vehicle registrations on the continent fell by 2.1 per cent in January to 995,271.

On Friday, Tesla wrapped up a seventh straight week of losses, its longest losing streak since debuting on the Nasdaq in 2010. The stock has fallen every week since CEO Elon Musk went to Washington, D.C., to take on a major role in the second Trump White House.

Since peaking at $479.86 on Dec. 17, Tesla shares have lost more than 50% of their value, wiping out upward of $800 billion in market cap. Monday marked the stock’s seventh worst day on record.

Tesla led a broader slump in U.S. equities, with the Nasdaq tumbling almost 4%, its steepest decline since 2022.

The downdraft in Tesla’s stock on Monday was tied to uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s plans on tariffs. Canada and Mexico are key markets for automotive suppliers, and increased tariffs, with the potential for a trade war, will likely affect production and lead to higher prices.

Tesla is also dealing with brand erosion due to Musk’s incendiary political rhetoric and his extensive work with the Trump administration, where he is leading up the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Musk, the world’s wealthiest person, has become the public face of the administration’s effort to dramatically shrink the federal government’s workforce, spending and capacity.

Meanwhile, Musk has used his social network X to level accusations against judges whose decisions he did not like and promoted false Kremlin talking points about Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Activists and former Musk fans have protested at Tesla facilities across the U.S., and Tesla vehicles and facilities have been the apparent targets of vandalism and arson attempts. Repeated arson attempts and instances of vandalism occurred at a Tesla store and service center in Loveland, Colorado, most recently on March 7, police told CNBC.

Ben Kallo, an analyst at Baird, told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Monday that recent reports of vandalism could hurt demand.

“When people’s cars are in jeopardy of being keyed or set on fire out there, even people who support Musk or are indifferent Musk might think twice about buying a Tesla,” Kallo said.

Analysts at Bank of America’s wrote in a report on Monday that Tesla’s new vehicle sales plummeted about 50% in Europe in January from a year earlier, partly owing to growing distaste for the brand. The firm also noted that some prospective customers are waiting for the new version of the Model Y.

Tesla’s Model Y, which is a small SUV, remained the best-selling battery electric vehicle globally in January. It was followed by China’s Geely Geome, which surpassed the Tesla Model 3 sedan for the month.

Global sales of electric vehicles, including fully electric and plug-in hybrid models, increased 21% in January from a year ago, even as Tesla’s sales declined. The growth was driven by demand in Europe, according to Bank of America.

The fund said in a statement that it had decided ""to blacklist Tesla due to verified violations of union rights in the United States.""
""Despite several years of dialogue with Tesla, including shareholder proposals in collaboration with other investors, the company has not taken sufficient measures to address the issues,"" the fund said.
AP7 spokesman Mikael Lindh Hok told AFP the fund had divested its entire stake, worth 13 billion kronor ($1.4 billion), in late May.
He said the stake represented one percent of the fund's total assets.
The electric carmaker has also been involved in a labour dispute with Swedish unions since 2023.
In late October of that year, the metal workers union IF Metall launched a strike against Tesla over its refusal to sign a collective wage agreement, and some 130 mechanics at 10 Tesla repair shops in seven cities walked off the job.
IF Metall then extended the strike to include work on Teslas at other repair shops which served multiple brands.
The strike then grew into a larger conflict between Tesla and almost a dozen unions seeking to protect Sweden's labour model, including postal workers, dock workers and even spreading to neighbouring Nordic countries.
Tesla chief Elon Musk has long rejected calls to allow the company's employees worldwide to unionise.
Musk's close cooperation with US President Donald Trump has also led to calls for boycotts against Tesla.",1962

Denholm said Musk was key to the future of the EV maker as it moves beyond being “just another car company,” with a bigger focus on Full Self Driving and Optimus.

“Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become,” Denholm wrote.

Denholm told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday that the company is at an “important inflection point” with artificial intelligence at the forefront.

“The opportunity for Tesla in the future, given this AI focus and attention and the unique capabilities that we have as an organization, and that Elon brings to us, really does mean that the opportunity for the company ahead of us is significant,” she said.

Several groups have publicly opposed the pay package in recent days, with proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services recommending against it.

Last week, a group of unions and corporate watchdogs launched the Take Back Tesla website to oppose the pay package, noting Musk’s embracing of right-wing political movements and amplifying of conspiracy theories that have damaged the brand.

Tesla’s annual meeting is Nov. 6, with the shareholder vote for Musk’s pay and other proposals closing at 11:59 p.m. ET on Nov. 5.

Tesla reported third-quarter financials last week, missing earnings expectations but posting a 12% increase in revenue after two straight periods of declines.

The proposed plan for Musk, which was outlined by the board in September, consists of 12 tranches of shares granted to Musk if Tesla hits certain milestones.

It would also give Musk increased voting power over the company, which he has publicly demanded for the past year and mentioned again on Tesla’s earnings call last week in reference to the growth of Optimus robots.

“If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?” Musk said to analysts. “I don’t feel comfortable building that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.”

The full award would give Musk, who already holds about 13% of the EV maker, more than 423 million additional shares and take his stake to about 25%.

“He’s been very consistent in that view, in terms of having enough influence over the vote of Tesla in the future so that bad things can’t happen with the AI,” Denholm told CNBC. “So it’s less about compensation and more about the voting influence.”

Denholm, who noted that retail traders make up about 30% of Tesla’s shareholder base, said last year was a record turnout for the vote.

She also asked that shareholders vote to re-elect Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson to the board.

Tesla may be the company for which Musk is best known, but his assets include several other prominent tech names, including SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter). This wide array of responsibilities concerned investors long before he accepted his new position at DOGE.
Now that he has this new position, Musk is spending even less time running his companies, and things haven’t been going well for any of them. While Tesla stock fell last week, a SpaceX rocket exploded during a test flight, and a cyberattack took X down, although users regained access fairly quickly.

A consortium of investors led by billionaire Elon Musk is offering $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit that controls artificial intelligence startup OpenAI, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.

The offer intensifies a longstanding battle between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Musk over the future of the startup at the heart of a boom in generative AI technology. Musk's attorney, Marc Toberoff, said he submitted the bid to OpenAI's board on Monday, according to the report.

""It's time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was,"" the WSJ cited Musk as saying in a statement provided by Toberoff. ""We will make sure that happens.""

Musk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015, but left before the company took off. He later founded the competing AI startup xAI in 2023.

OpenAI is now trying to transition into a for-profit from a nonprofit entity, which it says is required to secure the capital needed for developing the best artificial intelligence models.

Together, four top officers at the company have offloaded over $100 million in shares since early February.

Last week, longtime Musk ally James Murdoch -- the estranged son of Fox boss Rupert Murdoch and a board member since 2017 -- became the latest to do so, exercising a stock option and selling shares worth approximately $13 million, according to an SEC filing. The sale took place on March 10, coinciding with the stock's largest single-day decline in five years.

According to one filing, the shares were sold ""to cover the exercise price relating to the exercise of stock options to purchase 531,787 shares, which are scheduled to expire in 2025.""

Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal Musk, who also sits on the board, unloaded 75,000 shares worth approximately $27 million last month, according to a filing.

The chairman of the board, Robyn Denholm, has offloaded more than $75 million dollars worth of shares in two transactions in the past five weeks, federal filings show. The selloffs made by Denholm came as part of a predetermined sales plan.

A number of board members and executives made similar moves in November and December. But the recent sales come at a tumultuous time for Tesla, with the stock falling nearly 50% from a peak in mid-December. The company's shares have suffered most of those losses since President Donald Trump took office and Musk began his controversial governmental cost-cutting efforts as the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.

""Whenever insiders, including directors, are selling shares, it's not a positive signal,"" Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida, told ABC News.

However, Ritter added, an exception applies to the predetermined sales plan adopted by Denholm in July 2024, which marks a routine effort to avoid the perception an officer unloaded shares based on inside information.

""Filing a plan months ago to sell some of those shares over time is common,"" Ritter said.

Tesla did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

Seth Goldstein, an analyst at research firm Morningstar who studies the electric vehicle industry, said some of the stock sales may owe to personal financial choices made by individual officers.

""While a sale doesn't necessarily mean an executive or board member feels negatively about a company's outlook, it could mean they think the stock is at a fair price or even overvalued,"" Goldstein said.

The share selloffs made by board members and executives totaled about $118 million, but the transactions often came after the individuals exercised stock options, the costs of which totaled about $16 million. The officers ended up with a profit of just over $100 million.

ABC News previously reported on concerns from shareholders and pension funds, some of whom have called on Musk to turn his attention back from slashing government spending to running his car company.

Tesla Chief Financial officer Vaibhav Taneja also sold off shares totaling more than $5 million over recent weeks. Some of those transactions came as part of predetermined sales plans, but a transaction earlier this month did not stem from a scheduled sale.

The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) revealed on Tuesday that Tesla saw a 40% year-over-year drop in new vehicle registrations in Europe in February, while overall battery electric vehicle sales were up 26%.

Meanwhile, the White House said on Wednesday that President Trump will announce new tariffs on auto imports in the afternoon. The president has hyped April 2 as “liberation day” and “the big one” for rolling out his plan to impose heavy tariffs on foreign trading partners, but Trump hinted earlier this week that auto tariffs could arrive sooner.

Movements of this magnitude have become commonplace for Tesla’s stock. On 14 separate days this year, Tesla shares have gained or lost at least 5%. Wednesday’s selloff, alongside a 2% drop in the Nasdaq, followed a five-day rally that included a 12% jump on Monday.

The trend for the year has been downward, particularly since President Trump began his second term in January, and brought Tesla CEO Elon Musk with him to the White House. Tesla shares are down 36% since Inauguration Day, after falling 28% in February, the steepest drop for any month since December 2022.

Following the ACEA report on Tuesday, RBC analysts wrote in a note that the February numbers only represented a drop of about 11,000 Tesla vehicle registrations in Europe, and emphasized that data for the month “might not be indicative of true demand.”

New car buyers in Europe, the analysts said, “could be holding out for the Model Y refresh,” or a “new affordable model,” which they expect in the second half of the year.

Tesla is set to fully ramp up production of the redesigned version of its Model Y SUV next month. The company implemented partial production shutdowns at certain factories earlier this year to upgrade Model Y manufacturing lines.

Some prospective EV buyers have been turned off of late by Musk’s political rhetoric and his work for the Trump administration, where he’s leading an effort to slash federal government spending, cut the federal workforce, and has said he wants to privatize many services, including social security.

William Blair analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday that, “pushback from Musk’s foray into politics” has led to “brand damage and even vandalism,” for Tesla at a time when the company’s supply has been impacted by its Model Y changeover, and “Chinese competition continues to heat up.”

Still, the firm maintained its buy recommendation on Tesla’s stock, pointing to growth in the company’s energy storage business, and its prospects in driverless ride hailing. Musk has promised that Tesla will kick off a robotaxi service in Austin in June. The company has yet to begin production of its dedicated robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab.

Alphabet’s Waymo is already operating a commercial robotaxi service in Austin and other markets. And in China, several automakers are now offering an equivalent to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Supervised — a premium, partially automated driving system — as standard options rather than a paid service.

In China this week, Tesla renamed its FSD system “Intelligent Assisted Driving,” according to CNEVPost, after previously branding it as “Full Self-driving Capability.” Tesla’s system in all markets still requires a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

1l44wzw,2025-06-05 19:19:22,Reddit,stocks,TSLA,Tesla shares sink 8% as Musk-Trump spat over budget bill boils over,"Shares of Tesla slid 8% on Thursday as CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump traded barbs over the spending bill making its way through Congress.

Trump spoke from the Oval Office Thursday and said Musk was upset that EV credits were not included in the bill.

“Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday. “I was surprised.”

“Whatever,” Musk fired back as the president spoke.

“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” he posted on X.

Musk, the world’s richest man, in recent days has threatened to make lawmakers who vote for the bill face primary elections and called the bill a “disgusting abomination,” marking a significant shift in his comments about the administration.

The fall in shares comes after the EV maker saw a 22% rally in May despite weak sales numbers, with Musk wrapping up his time as head of Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Shares are down more than 20% this year and well off the high of $488.54 reached Dec. 18.

Since Musk’s special government employee term ended Friday, he’s appeared at odds with the Trump administration and gone on a full assault against the president’s signature tax-cut bill.

“One of the things about Elon is when he goes all in, he goes all in,” Walter Isaacson, author of a Musk biography, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Thursday.

“He is somebody who’s not exactly calibrated in these things and he is seriously upset,” Isaacson said.

NBC News reported that Musk had tried to convince Trump and other GOP members of the administration to change aspects of Trump’s bill that would curtail EV and residential solar tax credits, which generate profits for Tesla.

The measure would also impose a new annual $250 fee on EV drivers. 

Tesla is facing more fundamental problems, with plummeting sales of its electric vehicles in major markets in Europe and a declining brand reputation in the West.

Tesla is also under pressure to launch a long-delayed, driverless ride-hailing service this month in Austin, Texas.

Musk has said that Tesla is testing driverless vehicles in that market, but its primary competitor Waymo is already operating a major commercial robotaxi service there in partnership with Uber.

Isaacson said Thursday that Musk was also annoyed with members of the Trump administration who worked against the nomination of Jared Isaacman as head of space agency NASA.

“That, to Musk, was just infuriating because they were doing, they were going after Jared Isaacman ... to get at Musk,” Isaacson said Thursday.

Isaacman’s nomination was pulled over the weekend.

Isaacman led two private spaceflights through Musk’s SpaceX, in 2021 and 2024, commanding crews on trips around the Earth. His payment tech company Shift4 said in financial filings that as of June 30, 2021, it had invested $27.5 million in SpaceX as well.

CEO Sundar Pichai said Waymo has options in terms of “business models across geographies,” and the robotaxi company is building partnerships with ride-hailing app Uber, automakers and operations and maintenance businesses that tend to its vehicle fleets.

“We can’t possibly do it all ourselves,” said Pichai on a call with analysts for Alphabet’s first-quarter earnings. 

Pichai noted that Waymo has not entirely defined its long-term business model, and there is “future optionality around personal ownership” of vehicles equipped with Waymo’s self-driving technology. The company is also exploring the ways it can scale up its operations, he said.

The 250,000 paid rides per week are up from 200,000 in February, before Waymo opened in Austin and expanded in the San Francisco Bay Area in March. 

Waymo, which is part of Alphabet’s Other Bets segment, is already running its commercial, driverless ride-hailing services in the San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin regions.

Earlier this month, Waymo and its partner Uber, began allowing interested riders to sign up to try the robotaxi service in Atlanta when it opens this summer. 

The early pioneer in self-driving technology, Waymo has managed to beat Elon Musk-led Tesla and a myriad of now-defunct autonomous vehicle startups to the U.S. market.

Tesla is promising that it will be able to turn its Model Y SUVs into robotaxis by the end of June for a driverless ride-hailing service it plans to launch in Austin.

After about a decade of promises and missed deadlines, Tesla still does not offer a vehicle that’s safe to use without a human at the wheel ready to steer or brake at all times.

Musk criticized Waymo’s approach to driverless tech on his company’s first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday. Musk said Waymo autonomous vehicles are “very expensive” and made in only “low volume.” Tesla’s partially automated driving systems rely mostly on cameras to navigate, while Waymo’s driverless systems rely on lidar technology, other sensors and cameras.

Would-be competitors to Waymo also include Amazon-owned Zoox, Mobileye, May Mobility and international autonomous vehicle companies such as WeRide and Baidu’s Apollo Go.

Tesla (TSLA) stock slumped again on Thursday as the fallout continued to emerge from the very public policy blowout between President Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

""Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL,"" Musk posted on X on Wednesday.

Musk added, ""If the massive deficit spending continues, there will only be money for interest payments and nothing else!""

The vocal criticism is irking Trump, the Wall Street Journal reported, with a senior official claiming that White House advisors were ""caught off guard"" by Musk's latest broadsides.

Tesla stock fell solidly on Wednesday and extended those losses in premarket trading on Thursday, down as much as 3%.

The comments come after the one-time leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) waded earnestly into the debate over the bill this week, angrily posting Tuesday that it was a ""disgusting abomination.""

""I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,"" he said.

""Shame on those"" who voted for it in the House, Musk added.

Bloomberg reported that Musk may also be driven by the fact that the federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.

Musk's barrage comes as the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, and a Congressional Budget Office estimation of its impact on the deficit adds fuel to Musk's line of argument.

The nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.

The formerly Musk-led DOGE itself has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find, and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.

Musk's closeness to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for Tesla, given its business with SpaceX and NASA and the regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.

But demand weakness in the EU and recent protests at US Tesla showrooms have followed Musk's controversial foray into politics, causing some Tesla owners to become alienated by Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, DOGE, and outward support of President Trump.

Tesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin. Much of the company's value is tied to whether it can fully unlock autonomous driving for robotaxi purposes and individual owners.

Meanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo continues to plow ahead and is essentially the leader in the space, accumulating 250,000 robotaxi trips per week.",1297

On June 19, only a very small number of so-called Cybercabs will be used on the road, and only by invitation, but NHTSA still thinks this is wrong. Musk has not responded to NHTSA yet. What kind of autonomous driving will the so-called Cybercab be and how will it be regulated? Of course, Musk's good friends in the White House may directly ask NHTSA to give up all questions about Musk.

Musk is unfortunate because all the liars have been exposed before him, and he has to face more stringent investor supervision. For example, the protagonist of ""Bad Blood"", a lady who doesn't blink, investors are fed up with boasting but not delivering, and Musk must deliver. But the problem is that once it is delivered, the lie will be exposed.

Without L4 autonomous driving and Robotaxi comparable to Waymo, everything about him is being sniped. Just like when Cybertruck was released, Tesla fans asked me, ""Look, the slap is so fast and strong, call us daddy. Musk is a god."" Because in the previous year, I have been saying that Cybertruck has no market at all, this is a vertical segment. The main scene of Truck is work, not play. And they think that everything I, a dull ITIL consultant and a third-rate business school auditor, say is ridiculous. But after I shouted daddy to everyone in the chat room and accepted their humiliation. In less than a year, Cybertruck sales collapsed. I want to find them on Twitter and let them prove that I am not wrong. But they all said to me, ""Do facts matter? We made money, hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock market returns. Hold on to your truth and go back to Australia. Loser."" Now the same is true for Cybercab. Musk made it, but no one will pay for it. He can't even catch up with ""WAYMO, the backward smart driving using lidar"". After all, Waymo is L4 autonomous driving, certified by NHTSA. And Musk is L2. It's ridiculous.

The European market has given up subsidies for BEVs. The BEV market has collapsed. Now it is the hybrid market, which is dominated by Toyota. I believe that the United States will continue to subsidize and use taxpayers' money to build charging stations one after another, which will continuously put money into Musk's pocket.

1j19zlc,2025-03-01 22:15:49,Reddit,stocks,TSLA,Serious question: why do people think Tesla will survive?,"This isn't a highly technical question, but I think it is critical all the same. Why do people think Tesla will survive Musk?

Tesla is already grossly, wildly inflated beyond any other car company--and yes, it's still a car company--and has spent years failing to deliver FSD. That's starting to become a very, very large problem.

And Musk has now deeply and irrevocably alienated some 10-50% of potential investors and customers, some of whom were previously diehard Tesla fans. Those people are never buying a Tesla product. Ever. And you might think they are overreacting, or the salutes where just ""Roman,"" etc., but none of it changes the fact that they are forever boycotting Tesla.

The only two bullish arguments I can think of are, first, that Musk will create such uniquely amazing technology that everyone will forgive his indiscretions. But even if Musk has some unique, amazing magically technology--which he doesn't--who is going to use it? If Hitler has a monopoly on magic carpets, you don't reluctantly buy one. You just walk. Because if you buy the carpet, everyone else is going to think you're a Nazi. Even if you fire Hitler, no one is going to buy magic carpets from former Nazi carpet merchants, not for a very long time at least. And Tesla doesn't even have a monopoly. It's pretty far behind in some key areas.

The second argument would be that his affiliation with Trump will forever protect Tesla stock price. But Trump doesn't have a trillion dollars to give Musk, not that he would, and government largess isn't going to get you very far with extremely limited customers and investors.

So what's the case I'm missing here? Why wouldn't you short the hell out of this stock?

Edit: Thanks for the feedback, this has been productive. The best answer I'm seeing is that Tesla can get rid of Musk once he starts hurting the bottom line. That's a logical line of thought, but I think it is already too late. We shall see when and if it happens.

Edit 2: Friends, you don't have to do this, but please don't think Tesla will just be able to wash all of this with the right PR team and a new CEO. This isn't like Anheuser-Busch having a bad quarter because of a trans model. Tesla and its board apparently let a \*\*\*\* remain CEO. That's on Tesla, not just Musk. ""Never forget"" means never forget.

Edit 3: For stats: [32% of US car buyers today would not consider a Tesla versus only 17% in 2021](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2025/02/17/business/tesla-sales-elon-musk-politics); [Tesla favorability perception drops from 33% in 2018 to 9% by Jan. 2024 to 3% in Jan. 2025](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-sales-elon-musk-reputation-brand-damage-trump-doge/); [Tesla ranks least favorable among consumers interested in buying an EV](https://insideevs.com/news/749741/tesla-ev-buyers-favorability-rating/?utm_source=chatgpt.com); [Republicans like Musk but 48% don't like EVs](https://www.newsweek.com/republican-change-tune-elon-musk-not-tesla-2029028); [60% of UK car buyers refuse to consider a Tesla](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/01/30/uk-survey-finds-60-of-car-buyers-turned-off-by-elon-musk/); [one in three Dutch Tesla owners want to sell](https://insideevs.com/news/747944/tesla-owners-musk-survey-netherlands/), etc.

Those are brutal numbers. And maybe all of that damage can heal if Musk ever gets ousted. But with tightening competition, there's a point of no return.

Edit 4: Ok, so hard no on the ""but it isn't a car company"" angle. About 88-93% of Tesla's revenue is tied to automotive, meaning  it's actually more of a car company than other car companies, like, say, Volkswagen (15% financial services). Or BYD, which is \~80% automotive with the rest being electronics, energy, batteries, and semiconductors. So basically its a better Tesla.  And Tesla isn't a tech/AI/robot/home company for the same reason that McDonald's isn't: neither of them sell those products. ",1175

Musk, who has watched Tesla’s stock tumble more than 40% this year, said he’ll continue to support the president with DOGE “to make sure that the waste and fraud that we stop does not come roaring back.”

After spending almost $300 million in the 2024 campaign to help return Trump to the White House, Musk created DOGE and joined the administration with a mission to drastically reduce the size and capability of the federal government.

He said he’ll continue to spend a “day or two per week” on government issues “for as long as the president would like me to do so.”

> Elon Musk this week urged his followers to cancel their Netflix  subscriptions over a controversy surrounding an animated show and its creator. Musk on Wednesday posted on his X platform saying, “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids.” The post was in response to an image accusing Netflix of carrying out a “transgender woke agenda.” The controversy seems to stem from conservative backlash over an animated Netflix show, “Dead End: Paranormal Park,” which features a transgender character. The show was canceled in 2023 after two seasons.

> In addition to several anti-trans posts, Musk also responded to a post criticizing alleged statements made by the show’s creator, Hamish Steele, that a prominent conservative X account said “mocked” the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Steele responded to Musk’s callout on rival social media platform Bluesky saying, “It’s probably going to be a very odd day.” Steele also shared a post by TV writer Jack Bernhardt that called “Dead End” a “brilliant show about kind, wonderful characters.” Also this week, vocal conservative activist Robby Starbuck began posting about Netflix, echoing anti-trans sentiments and arguing the company has promoted an ideology that is “hateful to White Americans.” Starbuck, who has repeatedly targeted major corporations in recent months over diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, said in one of his X posts on Netflix, “No one should give this woke company another dime.”

> Analysts say the backlash might not pose as big of a threat to Netflix as Musk may be hoping for. Netflix reported 301.63 million subscribers as of the fourth quarter of 2024, the last time it reported the metric before shifting priority to revenue over user growth. The company has a roughly $490 billion market cap, and its stock is up more than 60% in the past year. Shares lost nearly 5% over the week.

Reddit, the American online discussion platform, has overtaken X to become the fifth most popular social media platform in the UK, according to the communications watchdog.

Ofcom said Reddit, where users post on discussion threads within topic-based communities, was visited by 22.9 million UK adults in May this year, compared with 22.1 million on X.

The figures make Reddit the fastest-growing large social media platform in the UK and represent a growth of 47% on the same period in 2023. The leap took Reddit above LinkedIn and X into fifth place on the table of UK social media platforms, which is now topped by YouTube after it overtook [Facebook](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook), reaching more than 44 million adults.

Reddit, renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as Redditors, appears to have been boosted by updates to Google’s search engine this year.

Farhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, said: “Google’s latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave Reddit a big boost in organic search traffic. I think that has probably contributed a lot.”

Ofcom also speculated that the change may have been caused [by alterations to how third-party apps accessed its content](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/reddit-moderators-vow-to-continue-blackout-in-api-access-fees-row), forcing users of those apps to switch to the Reddit site. The watchdog also flagged publicity around Reddit’s stock market flotation in March this year.

The popularity of X also fell over the same period, according to Ofcom, with its reach falling by 8% since May last year. X has been criticised over content moderation standards since its [takeover by Elon Musk in 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal) but it has also faced competition since July 2023 from Threads, a rival to X [launched by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/06/meta-launches-twitter-rival-threads-in-100-countries).

The Ofcom figures featured in the watchdog’s annual report into the nation’s digital habits, which revealed that four out of 10 UK adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes, with the majority of those cases occurring online.

The misinformation survey, based on a poll of more than 4,000 UK adults, also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together, with the same number believing there is “significant evidence” of electoral fraud in the UK.

The regulator also found that one-third of UK adults are not confident in judging whether an image or a piece of audio or video has been created by artificial intelligence.",1076

Tesla sold 63,238 units of its electric cars in January, down 11.5% from the 71,447 cars sold in the same month last year.

Shares of Tesla were down about 1.5% in premarket trading.

Chinese rival BYD meanwhile sold 296,446 pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles last month, up 47% year-on-year.

Other Chinese rivals of Tesla, including Changan Automobile and Xpeng, also posted growth in sales.

Tesla has attempted to use price cuts as an incentive to retain Chinese’ buyers interest in its car. Late last year, Tesla slashed the price of its Model Y car and also extended a zero-interest five-year loan plan until the end of January.

Last month, the U.S. giant also announced a revamped version of the Model Y — one of its best-selling EV autos — in China. This also came with a 0% interest plan.

Tesla has not introduced a new model since it began delivering the Cybertruck in late 2023, which starts at nearly $80,000. Investors have been yearning for a new mass-market model from the company to reinvigorate sales.

Tesla has said a new affordable model could be launched in the first half of 2025.

Meanwhile, the automaker is pushing to launch its driver assist system, which it markets as “Full Self Driving,” in China this year, as rivals also roll out similar features.

The payout includes $129 million in compensatory damages, and $200 million in punitive damages against Tesla. Attorneys for the plaintiffs had asked the jury to award damages of around $345 million. The trial in the Southern District of Florida started on July 14.

The suit centered around who shouldered the blame for the deadly crash in Key Largo, Florida. A Tesla owner named George McGee was driving his Model S electric sedan while using the company’s Enhanced Autopilot, a partially automated driving system.

While driving, McGee dropped his mobile phone that he was using and scrambled to pick it up. He said during the trial that he believed Enhanced Autopilot would brake if an obstacle was in the way. His Model S accelerated through an intersection at just over 60 miles per hour, hitting a nearby empty parked car and its owners, who were standing on the other side of their vehicle.

Naibel Benavides, who was 22, died on the scene from injuries sustained in the crash. Her body was discovered about 75 feet away from the point of impact. Her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, survived but suffered multiple broken bones, a traumatic brain injury and psychological effects.

1j7zm8c,2025-03-10 15:16:06,Reddit,stocks,TSLA,Why the 2025 Bear Market is the real deal & only just getting started,"When it comes to recent major market corrections, the largest drops have coincided with the loosening of interest rates. There have been market corrections outside of these periods, however, those events are significantly lesser in scope compared to the current analog situations of 2000, 2008, and 2020. 

The Fed Funds rate was held at 6.5% from June 2000 to December 2000. It was 5.25 from July of 2006 to July of 2007. It was 2.4 between January of 2019 and July of 2019. 

As the Fed began cutting rates, in each situation, the market began to decline. However, it was during these declines that illiquidity events took place, causing major panic, and subsequent cratering of markets. 

The 1-point decline in interest rates from peak coincides with February 2001, December 2007, and November of 2019. Each respective recession officially began in March of 2001, December of 2007, and February 2020. 

We hit 1-point below peak in January. There is a strong possibility we are ALREADY in recession, however, genius economists will only tell us this in a year or two. 

In any case, each of these recessions coincided with feat contagion and general panic. Each of these events also bottomed after major catastrophes - in 2000 it was 9/11 and Enron, in 2008 it was Lehman + subprime crisis, in 2019 it was.... that horrible thing that we no longer talk about. 

We are already in the fear stage of the market. 2000's panic was a general meltdown PRIOR to the crises that later unfolded. However, it was those crises that marked its bottom. 2008 and 2020's craterings occurred simultaneous to their crises although stocks did drift down prior to 2008 as well. 

This begs the question: what is the crisis that may or may not occur with the cyclical correction that happens as the Fed cuts rates EVERY cycle? Will it be a true black swan no-one saw coming (9/11) or will it be something like Enron, Lehman, or COVID, where some DID see what was coming ahead of the general panic?

Could TSLA be the Enron of the 2025 bust? It is seeming more and more plausible with each passing day. In any case, the bottom of the market in each of the aforementioned cases occurred simultaneous to the Fed funds rate hitting 0 (or almost 0 in 2003). I expect shelter contribution to CPI to vanish in the next few reports + unemployment to rise significantly, this could give the Fed leeway to put rates back to 0 as soon as Q3-Q4 2025. In both 2009 and 2020 the Fed rate hit 0 when annualized CPI did the same (in March), and March of both years also coincided with their respective market bottoms. 

TLDR; we are far from the bottom, which should occur when Fed Funds hit 0, buy when that happens but before that point, gird your loins.",980

In a post on X on Monday, Musk wrote, ”\~80% of Tesla’s value will be Optimus.” In mid-2024, Musk predicted that Optimus robots would someday turn Tesla into a $25 trillion company, which was equal to more than half of the entire value of the S&P 500 at the time of his comment.

With Tesla in the midst of a multi-quarter sales slump due to competition from lower-cost Chinese competitors, an aging lineup of electric vehicles and Musk’s incendiary political rhetoric and involvement with the Trump administration, the world’s richest person has been trying to convince Wall Street to look to the future.

For Tesla, that dream revolves around a world filled with robotaxis and humanoid robots, powered by artificial intelligence.

“It is important to note that Tesla is by far the best in the world at real-world AI,” Musk said in the company’s second-quarter conference call with analysts in July.

The problem for Tesla is that it’s behind in those key markets.

In robotaxis, Tesla has only recently started tests in Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, while Alphabet’s Waymo is live in numerous markets and reached 10 million paid trips in May. Baidu’s Apollo Go is live in China.

Meanwhile, competition in humanoid robots is coming from the likes of Chinese companies like Unitree, which won multiple medals at the World Humanoid Robot Games. Others in the space include Boston Dynamics, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, 1X and Figure.

Musk said in March that Tesla plans to make 5,000 of its Optimus robots this year. In its first-quarter shareholder deck, Tesla said it was on target for “builds of Optimus on our Fremont pilot production line in 2025, with wider deployment of bots doing useful work across our factories.”

Tesla recently lost the person running the division.

Milan Kovac, Tesla’s vice president of Optimus robotics, announced his departure in June after nine years at the company.

Tesla is developing Optimus with the aim of someday selling it as a bipedal, intelligent robot capable of everything from factory work to babysitting.

1jgj4af,2025-03-21 16:12:28,Reddit,stocks,TSLA,Tesla’s Retail Fans Buy the Stock at a Pace Never Seen Before,"Tesla Inc.’s stock is in a freefall. Its sales are plunging around the world. Even its most avid Wall Street bulls are turning cautious. But one group is buying the electric-vehicle maker’s shares like never before: CEO Elon Musk’s fans.
The company has always had a strong fan-base among individual investors, who hang on Musk’s every word on X, the social-media platform he owns. They analyze Tesla in great detail in online forums, and largely function as a hype crew for the stock.
But their current level of enthusiasm is staggeringly high, even by recent historical standards. Individual investors have been net buyers of Tesla shares for 13 straight sessions through Thursday, pumping $8 billion into the stock, retail trading data from JPMorgan Chase’s global equity derivatives strategist Emma Wu shows. That’s the biggest inflow over any buying streak since 2015, which is as far back as the data goes.

What makes the buying notable is Tesla’s share price has sunk 17% over this time, wiping out more than $155 billion from its market value.
“Tesla made some rookie to mid-stage public market investors extremely wealthy, a lot of people became millionaires because of this stock,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research. “People don’t forget that. And they will come back to a stock again and again if they feel it has been beaten up.”
Tesla shares have been on a steep slide since mid-December when it touched an all-time high fueled by optimism from Donald Trump’s election victory. But that euphoria vanished, with the stock retreating more than 50% from its Dec. 17 record, making it the second biggest decliner in the S&P 500 Index this year. The rout has been so brutal that on Thursday Musk sought to reassure Tesla employees during an all-hands meeting, telling them to “hang on to your stock.”

What’s become clear is what Wall Street thought was a bonus for the company, Musk’s prominent role in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, has become an albatross. His growing political presence and involvement with controversies in Europe have triggered a backlash against the company and its leader, with the cars increasingly seen as political symbols. Protesters have thrown Molotov cocktails at Tesla showrooms, and vandalized charging stations.

The impact is showing up in the company’s financials. Sales of the Tesla’s cars have sunk in key European markets, such as France and Germany, as well as in China and Australia. The US numbers won’t be available until the company reports its first-quarter delivery figures early next month, but analysts across Wall Street have been aggressively cutting their estimates for sales and profits, citing the bleak data from around the globe.

On Thursday, long-time Tesla bull and Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas lowered his price target on the stock and reduced his sales expectations for the company citing growing competition, an aging vehicle lineup and a “buyers’ strike from negative brand sentiment.” However, he kept his buy-equivalent rating on the shares, saying the weak near-term expectations are “not particularly narrative changing” for a company whose future depends on robotics and artificial intelligence.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives on Friday lauded Musk’s efforts for “hand holding” employees and investors at a key time, and said that if the CEO continued to lead on his vision the stock will be on a growth path where 90% of its valuation will be led by autonomous driving technology and robotics. This bullishness explains at least some of retail traders’ continuing enthusiasm for the shares.
“These kind of investors don’t care about valuations at all,” Colas said. “They just believe in the future of the company and Elon Musk’s abilities.”

""Canada has frozen $43 million in payments to Tesla pending a line-by-line investigation into its last-minute surge in EV rebate claims made on the final weekend of the government program.

The American EV maker run by U.S. presidential adviser Elon Musk will also be excluded from all future EV rebate programs as long as tariffs are in place, former transport minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement.

The stop-payment order appears to have been made before the current election was called Sunday, though Freeland only confirmed it Tuesday, while on the campaign trail for her University—Rosedale seat.

“As soon as I became Transport Minister, I asked the department to stop all payments for Tesla vehicles in order to fully examine each claim individually and determine whether all are eligible and valid. No payments will be made until we are confident that the claims are valid,” she said in a statement texted to the Star.

“I also directed my department to change the eligibility criteria for future iZEV programs to ensure that Tesla vehicles will not be eligible for incentive programs so long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada.”""

As we all know, their stock performance is often decoupled from results. Little movement in futures so far, but curious how it’ll move tomorrow. 

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

…

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

Tesla’s dominance in the EV market is slipping, and nowhere is that more obvious than in China. According to new report from CNBC, Tesla’s sales in China dropped 11.5% this January compared to the same time last year. With China setting the pace for the global EV industry, Tesla is rapidly losing ground to local giants like BYD.

It’s not just a sales dip, it’s a wipeout. In January, BYD sold 30% more EVs than Tesla worldwide. The reason? Cost and variety.

While Tesla leans on price cuts to compete, Chinese brands like BYD are already priced lower from the start. Tesla’s profit margins, once its strong suit, are shrinking fast, while BYD keeps scaling production without sacrificing profitability. The Model 3 and Model Y Tesla’s core models are struggling to hold their own against a flood of cheaper, high-tech, government-backed alternatives.

For years, Tesla thrived under China’s policies that welcomed foreign EV makers. That era is over. The Chinese government has made it clear, they want their own brands to lead the global EV race. Companies like BYD, Nio, and XPeng are now the priority, while Tesla is increasingly seen as an outsider.

Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory, once a strategic advantage, is now a vulnerability. The Chinese government could tighten regulations",1787

From [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline?embedded-checkout=true):

The U.S. Department of Defense has added Tencent Holdings and CATL to its blacklist of companies allegedly linked to China's military, causing Tencent's U.S.-listed shares to drop nearly 10%. This move is part of the Pentagon's ""Section 1260H list,"" which now names 134 firms believed to support China's military-civil fusion strategy, where civilian tech is leveraged for military purposes.

Tencent, known for WeChat and major gaming investments, has denied the allegations and plans to work with U.S. authorities to clear up what it calls a misunderstanding. Similarly, CATL, a key supplier of EV batteries to Tesla, Ford, and BMW, refuted the claims, calling their inclusion a mistake and stating they have no involvement in military activities.

While the designation doesn't impose immediate sanctions, it signals increased risk for U.S. investors and partners. Companies previously added to this list, like DJI, have faced serious business disruptions, including bans and reputational hits.

Both Tencent and CATL are expected to challenge the decision, but this adds to the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. Investors should keep an eye on this situation as it could impact these stocks and broader U.S.-China market relations.

(A longform ELI5 explainer on why the bond market is reacting — and why that's dangerous)","OK Reddit, I have been asked to synthesize a few ELI5 posts I made over the past week into an explainer, because folks found them helpful.  Believe me, it’s an exciting action story, covering the fall of Randy Reliable, cutthroat geopolitical macroeconomics, and some face-punching.  And you’ll learn why people in the know are worried. 

**TL;DR**: Bond yields aren’t just a number — they’re a signal of trust. And when the 10-year treasury starts rising during a market crash, it’s not a good sign. It means the world is losing faith in the U.S. Here’s why that’s dangerous, what it says about our leadership, and how macroeconomic pressure is the new frontline in geopolitical power.

## **Trade Wars and Tariffs, or, *How I Learned to Start Worrying and Watch the Bonds***

Over the past two weeks, equity markets have plummeted in response to Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement.  However, by the middle of last week, the 10-year treasury yield began to rise sharply overnight. Those in the know started to worry- a lot.  The following day, Trump significantly revised some of his tariff policy, citing bond market “queasiness."" This brief primer is designed to help ordinary folks understand the basics and gain the macroeconomic literacy necessary to grasp these times, what may be happening, and why it is so concerning. 

## **What is a Treasury Bond?**

Imagine the U.S. government borrows money from people for 10 years and promises to pay them back with a little extra (interest). That “little extra” is called the yield. A treasury is essentially that. It’s an instrument through which the government borrows money and agrees to pay back more after a certain period of time.  So the 10-year treasury is a loan the government will repay in 10 years with a bit more.

Let’s say I buy a treasury for $10 and receive $11 back from the government over 10 years. That’s a 10% return over its lifespan, or about 0.96% annually if compounded, but approximately 1% per year if simplified. We refer to that as a 1% yield.

Why does selling bonds cause prices to decrease? It's simple: supply and demand, just as selling stocks lowers their prices. When you suddenly sell a large quantity of anything, the price drops because supply exceeds demand.

Now let’s say I sell that bond for $8 because someone is dumping bonds and prices are falling. That bond still pays $11 over its life. So the person who buys it from me is getting a $3 gain on an $8 investment — or a 37.5% total return over 10 years. This translates to about a 3.2% annual return (compounded) — a big jump from the original 1% yield! 

As you can see, when bond prices go down, yields go up — they move inversely.

This is worth emphasizing:  The U.S. always repays the same amount ($11) regardless of how much someone later buys the bond for on the secondary market ($8).

- If the bond sells for $12 later, the U.S. pays back $11.

- If the bond sells for $10 later, the U.S. pays $11.

- If the bond sells for $8 later, the U.S. pays $11.

The reason the yield changes is not due to what the U.S. repays, but because the secondary market buyer paid a different amount for that return.   Making back $11 from a $12, $10, or $8 investment results in different profits, and thus different yields.

Why would someone sell a bond for $8 at a loss that is guaranteed to eventually pay $11 (in 10 years)?  Because they need the $8 now and don't want to wait 10 years for the bond to mature!  Or they might think they can get better than a 3.2% return by investing the money elsewhere.  Just as it makes sense for you to withdraw money from your bank account, even if it's guaranteed to earn you 2% interest, because you need to pay your rent or because you believe you can do better than 2% by YOLO-ing into 0-day TSLA puts.

## **Why Should I Care About the 10-Year Treasury?**

Remember my example where I sold my bond for $8, which caused the yield to rise to 3.2%? Now, when the government needs to borrow money again, it can’t offer the previous 1% yield. Why? Because people can simply buy that 3.2% yielding bond on the open market. To stay competitive, the government must raise the interest rate on new bonds to satisfy market demands. As a result, it ends up paying more to borrow money.

Think about it this way:  Imagine you’re a builder in a town called Springville. For years, you’ve successfully sold one-bathroom houses for $100,000. However, Springville has evolved. It's now a family-oriented town, and everyone wants two bathrooms. The one-bathroom homes you previously built are now selling for only $50,000 on the resale market, as buyers realize they will need to spend an additional $50,000 to add a second bathroom.

Here’s the issue: You can’t continue building one-bathroom houses and expect to sell them for $100,000. Buyers won’t be interested. Why would they, when the market values a one-bathroom home at $50,000?

If you want to maintain that $100,000 price tag, you’ll need to provide more value, such as including the second bathroom from the beginning. The same applies to the U.S. Treasury. If it wishes to keep issuing debt, it has to match what the market currently provides. Otherwise, investors will simply look elsewhere.

You might say:  Well, so what? I don’t care what the government pays in interest.  Not my problem!

*Oh, it is very, very much your problem.*

This is because the 10-year treasury yield is a benchmark.  Many other loans (like mortgages, car loans, student loans, and business loans) key off of it.

So when the yield goes up, it means the U.S. government has to pay more to borrow — and so do you.

Higher yields = higher interest rates across the board.

That’s bad for:

- **Homebuyers** – higher mortgage rates = higher monthly payments

- **Businesses** – higher borrowing costs = harder to invest, hire, or expand

- **The government** – more of the federal budget goes toward interest payments instead of programs like schools or infrastructure

- **The stock market** – investors shift money out of stocks and into safe, high-yielding bonds, pushing stock prices down

Basically, because so many interest rates are tied to the 10-year treasury yield, any increase in that yield raises the cost of capital for the entire economy. Getting money becomes more expensive. Business slows down. At the same time, stock prices drop.

It’s a double whammy.

That’s why people watch the health of the treasury market so closely — because it impacts nearly everything in the economy, even if you don’t own a single bond yourself.

## **Why is the 10-Year treasury such an important benchmark?**

I want to say “just because” — but that wouldn’t satisfy you.

It’s not that the 10-year treasury must be the benchmark, but it’s the one everyone watches because it hits the sweet spot.

Treasuries (so far) are considered “risk-free.” They’re backed by the U.S. government and are super liquid. That liquidity and low risk provide the market a ton of real-time data about inflation expectations and the overall cost of capital. So they’re a natural baseline for figuring out what riskier borrowing should cost.

Imagine you have a friend, Randy Reliable, who’s always good for his money. Everyone is willing to loan him money at 2%. He borrows a lot, so there’s plenty of data on what rate people charge him — and you can be confident that 2% is the right baseline.

Then Sam Suspicious comes along and wants to borrow. You don’t know exactly what to charge him, but since you know what Randy pays, you simply add a risk premium to that. That’s how the market treats borrowers — it builds off the known “risk-free” rate.

But why the 10-year treasury specifically? It’s not too short (like a 2-year) or too long (like a 30-year). It captures market expectations about inflation, economic growth, and Fed policy over a medium-to-long horizon, making it the go-to reference point for many long-term loans.

Many countries have their own 10-year bond benchmarks, but Randy Reliable, the U.S. 10-year treasury, remains the gold standard globally.  In Europe, most euro-denominated contracts don’t key off the U.S. treasury. Instead, the German 10-year Bund is the de facto benchmark; it’s seen as the most stable and liquid bond in the Eurozone.  Other examples include:

- UK 10-year Gilt – a common benchmark for domestic British rates.

- Japanese 10-year  – used domestically, though heavily influenced by BOJ policy.

- Chinese 10-year – also exists, but tends to be more policy-driven and less market-transparent.

These bonds exist and are useful, but their reliability and global relevance can vary, especially when markets perceive a government as unstable, opaque, or overly interventionist.

The US 10-year beats these because it checks all the boxes:

- Deep liquidity

- Transparent, market-based pricing

- Long track record of stability

- Dollar dominance — many contracts worldwide are USD-denominated

- Safe-haven status during global crises

When benchmarking global risk, Randy Reliable (aka the U.S. 10Y) remains the handsome, well-dressed guy with a good credit score.  If you benchmark against another country and it suddenly does something wild (Brexit, for example), you get burned. That’s why predictability is essential — investors need confidence, not surprises.

## **So It’s Good to Be Randy Reliable?**

Yes, it is indeed good to be Randy Reliable. The dollar’s position as the global reserve currency grants the U.S. considerable soft power. Countries often avoid financially attacking the U.S. as those actions tend to backfire on their own economies, making economic retaliation against the U.S. both risky and costly.  Additionally, high global demand for U.S. dollars keeps the dollar strong internationally, allowing Americans to purchase foreign goods more affordably.

However, there’s a downside:

A strong dollar also makes American exports more expensive, which can hurt U.S. manufacturers selling abroad.

That’s why undermining the dollar's status as a reserve currency is an unspoken (but nearly essential) goal of Trump's agenda, even if he is not fully aware of it.  Yet, it’s a perilous strategy as it significantly weakens the U.S.  A good article discussing all this can be found here:  https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/how-trump-could-dethrone-dollar.

## **It All Comes Down to Trust and Predictability?**

Now you’re getting it.  The yield on the 10-year is seen as a key indicator of trust in the U.S. economy and its macroeconomic leadership.

So what if old Randy Reliable develops a ketamine habit and begins threatening his friends?  Well, suddenly he doesn’t seem like such a safe person to lend to. 

This is why the “long part of the curve” for treasuries (i.e., 10-year, 30-year) is often seen as an indicator of the financial health of the United States economy.  Are we Randy Reliable or Randy Reckless?  That’s the question the world is asking right now, and it reflects in the yield curve. Add potential strategic bond selling pressure from China and other countries on top of that, and we have a problem.  I’ll get to that in a bit.

## **The Yield is the Entire Field**

So, putting it all together, the 10-year yield is a key barometer of the health and strength of the U.S. economy and the trust in American economic leadership.  As that trust erodes, folks see the U.S. as a riskier borrower.  So the rates they’re comfortable charging to loan money to the U.S. go up. 

Typically, during periods of financial uncertainty, the yield on 10-year treasuries goes DOWN.  That’s because long treasuries – lending to Randy Reliable – have always been regarded as a safe haven.  Remember, it represents the risk-free rate!  When equities (stocks) weaken, investors usually shift their money into that safe place.  More buyers lead to an increase in the value of treasuries. Because value and yield are inversely related, the 10-year yield declines.

But that’s not what we saw last week!  Instead, while stock prices were falling, the 10-year yield was increasing.  That was… weird.  The markets no longer saw treasuries as their safe haven.  That’s a scary thought.  It implied a market losing faith in the United States and concluding it was actually Randy Reckless. 

## **Wasn’t I Supposed to Be Worried About an Inverted Yield Curve?**

Aren’t higher long-term bond yields a good thing?  You may have heard that an inverted yield curve is a worrisome sign.  That’s when long-term bonds have a lower yield than short-term bonds.  This situation is also anomalous because you would expect longer-term loans to have higher risk.  More time means a greater opportunity for the lender to default or for inflation to wreck you.  This higher risk typically leads to a higher rate of long-term bonds compared to short-term bonds. 

An inverted yield curve is a signal.  It historically signals a recession and is worth monitoring.  Remember, when equities and other investments decline, we expect people to seek safety – like Randy Reliable – leading to a drop in 10-year yields. Therefore, while an inverted yield curve is concerning, it’s still NORMAL. It remains just a signal, not a systemic risk in itself.

Rising 10-year yields during market weakness present a different type of danger: strategic selling by foreign holders or a decline in confidence in U.S. creditworthiness.

That’s not a recession signal. That is the disease.

That’s a sovereign confidence event.

Different animal. Nastier teeth.

## **What Does China, Japan, and Canada Have to do with This?**

Now, China has almost $800 billion in treasuries (and they are also a big buyer, which creates demand). Japan holds even more — about $1 trillion.  Canada also has a sizeable holding. These can move markets.

And remember, even if China holds only a small fraction of the total outstanding treasuries, what matters is the float — that is, how much is being bought and sold at any given time. For example, suppose typically 1% of the houses in your city are on sale at any time. Now, a real estate mogul decides to sell all of his houses, which make up 2% of the housing stock. That’s a small fraction of all the homes in the city, but it triples the supply for sale. There aren’t enough buyers for that. So, prices drop. A lot.

Even though it’s just a 2% change in total inventory, it’s a huge disruption to normal market activity. Japan, China, and Canada can impact the treasury market in a similar way. If they sell a lot at once, particularly if others are selling treasuries too, there simply won’t be enough buyers with cash ready, and that’s what we refer to as a liquidity crunch or a low-liquidity situation. Since China is a major buyer of treasuries, it can also influence the demand side by halting its purchases.

## **Bond Market Chess vs. Trade War Checkers**

Conversely, the increase in the 10-year yield last week may have resulted from major sovereign bondholders striking the United States right where it hurts.  They can engage in macroeconomic Bond Market Chess while Trump and the United States play Tariff Checkers.  And China, Japan, and Canada wouldn’t even need to crash the market — just sell slowly and steadily, nudging the long end of the yield curve upward over time. This matches what we are witnessing now. That alone can quietly erode the U.S. economy. Think boiling frog.

The Chinese can then take the capital released from their treasury sales and reinvest it into their domestic economy — infrastructure, industrial policy, and innovation — effectively blunting the impact of a trade war. So, they’re hitting the brakes on us while stepping on the gas at home.

China is smart enough to know this, and they have the tools to do it.  So are Canada and Japan.  Indeed, the current Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, is one of the smartest macroeconomic thinkers out there.  

The dollar’s status as the global reserve currency gives the U.S. immense advantages. But there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and this kind of yield exposure is the price we pay for that privilege. As the saying goes, “With great power comes great responsibility.”

When the U.S. is strong, stable, and globally engaged, the financial pool is too deep for even China and other countries to make a splash. But if we start pulling back from the global economy, undermining our own institutions, and projecting unreliability, that’s when the macroeconomic knives can come out and actually hurt us... a lot. This is particularly true if we, through belligerent economic policies,  encourage other Western or Western-aligned countries to collaborate against American interests.

This is exactly why people like me are warning that Trump’s policies are not only misguided but also economically dangerous, fundamentally undermining American power.

## **Can’t the Fed Do Something?**

Yes and no, but not really.  Yes, the Fed can step in and buy long-term treasuries — that’s what it did during previous rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE).

But there’s a catch: it’s much harder for the Fed to control the long end of the yield curve (10- and 30-year bonds) because those markets are massive and heavily influenced by investor sentiment regarding inflation, growth, and fiscal credibility.

When the Fed buys bonds, it can lower yields. However, doing so aggressively on the long end could send a dangerous signal: that the Fed is suppressing risk in a manner that markets may not deem sustainable.

If the underlying issue is fiscal credibility, QE can backfire — driving up inflation fears and ultimately causing long-term yields to rise instead of fall.

So yes, the Fed can intervene, but doing so risks unmooring inflation expectations, weakening the dollar, and undermining confidence in treasury markets.

## **So Why Not Just Make Those Chinese-Held Bonds Null and Void?**

After reading this primer, many have suggested, why don’t we just declare Chinese-held treasuries null and void? We have the power to take that leverage from them!

No, we do not have that power.  Do you want to crash the entire bond market and cause the US to default on its national debt?  Because that’s how you do it.  This would be an economic catastrophe of the highest order and would make the Great Depression look like a mere blip.

It’s as if someone is out there spreading rumors about your violent tendencies.  So, in retaliation, you publicly punch them in the face. Voiding China’s notes makes about as much sense.  It simply proves exactly what the market was unsure about.    

As an example, suppose you, Charlie, Joan, Peter, and Mary each loan me $10,000.

I decide I hate Peter and tell him I’m not paying back his loan and that I won’t repay it if he sells it to anyone else.  Peter’s loan becomes worthless.  This situation is called a default. 

Charlie, Joan, and Mary all realize that I could easily default on their loans as well.  So, they panic and sell their loans as quickly as they can because now they don’t trust me.

The value of the notes drops to zero or close to it because nobody trusts me to pay them back.

Now, I go out to the market and ask for more loans.  Nobody wants to lend me money except at extortionate rates.

## **What Can We Do?**

Ultimately, fixing this will require a great deal of time and rebuilding trust.  Unfortunately, trust is not something the Fed can print out of thin air, or that the President of the United States can enact through an Executive Order.  Trust comes from relationships and time.

There’s an old adage:  Trust takes decades to build, a moment to lose, and forever to regain.  We are witnessing that in real time.  Restoring trust may well take decades now.  There will be no easy fix.  Hopefully, now that you understand the macroeconomic issues, you can begin the hard work ahead.

1kb4bkz,2025-04-30 03:12:12,Reddit,investing,TSLA,Financial professionals mostly aren't paid to care what happens to the S&P 500 the day after tomorrow,"Container volumes at the port of Los Angels are down this week. They'll be down farther next week. We know this because arrivals are scheduled in advance and crossing the ocean by boat takes awhile. Container volumes at east coast ports are expected to do the same thing, but on a delayed schedule, because ""Shanghai, through the Panama Canal to New York City"" is a longer trip than ""Shanghai to Los Angels"".

And because of *that*, it's a safe bet truckers will have trouble finding work next month. Large-scale retail layoffs seem likely to follow soon thereafter. Very little can be done to stop this, because even if the tariffs on China were lifted tomorrow, it takes 3-7 weeks to get merchandise from a Chinese port to an American retail store. (Plus, I feel pretty confident saying the tariffs on China won't be lifted any time soon.)

A natural question when you hear this is, ""if that's true, why isn't the stock market down more?"" And I think a lot of the answer to this question can be summed up as: **hardly anyone is paid to care.**

I was going to title this post ""financial professionals mostly aren't paid to care what happens to your index funds the day after tomorrow"", but the **index fund providers** *are* paid to care... in the sense that they are paid to care about minimizing tracking error. They are paid to make sure that when the index goes up X%, the fund captures those games, and when the index goes down Y%, the fund doesn't do any worse than that. But they aren't paid to know whether the index will be up or down tomorrow. And this is not a criticism! It's not their job.

Who's job is it? For **high-frequency traders**, it's pretty much the opposite of their job. Their job is to do a trade and unwind it a few milliseconds later at a penny-per-share profit. And some of the hate HFTs get strikes me as overwrought; before HFTs were skimming a penny a share off every trade, floor traders were skimming 12½ cents (because stock prices used to be quoted in eighths of a dollar). But HFTs definitely don't care about what's going to happen to the trucking industry next month.

Now, despite what you may have heard, HFTs aren't the *entire* stock market. HFTs like to do small, quick trades. So instead, if somebody wants to sell half a million shares of TSLA, they might call around to various **dealers** and ask for quotes. The dealers will quote numbers below what an HFT would pay for *ten* shares of TSLA, but hopefully high enough that the seller agrees to the deal, and then the dealers will need to sell the stock to someone else, and that can't be done in a matter of milliseconds. Maybe they unwind their position over the course of 24 hours. So when the dealer gives a quote, they might be thinking about what the market could do tomorrow—but they hope that by the day after tomorrow it will be somebody else's problem.

Okay, but those are the middle-men. What about **professional stock-pickers**, active mutual fund managers, long-short hedge fund managers? Unfortunately, they also aren't paid to care what the S&P 500 will do the day after tomorrow. Managers of actively managed mutual funds care how they do compared to their benchmark, which is generally an index. If the index is down, that's fine, as long as *their* stocks are down less (or perhaps realistically, for risk-averse managers, aren't down significantly more). Meanwhile, a long-short hedge fund, which buys some stocks while shorting others, wants to be able to tell its investors that whether the broad market is up or down will have *no effect whatsoever* on the fund's performance.

So yes, actively managed mutual funds and long-short hedge funds are going to take a longer-term view of stocks they are thinking of buying or selling. And yes, they will care if companies could be affected by tariffs more than others. But even if they start to suspect *every* company should be down as a result of tariffs, they're not going to smash a big red button labeled ""sell everything"", because that's not their job.

Maybe it's *somebody's* job to care, but honestly it's hard to come up with a good business model based around that sort of thing. If you realize a crash is coming, but get the timing wrong, you could lose a lot of money—like if you went all-in shorting the market in 1999, when the dot-com bubble wouldn't burst until the following year. And if get the timing of *this* crash right because you bothered to look up how fast freight moves, how does that let you correctly time the next crash? It's not a lot to build a career on.

Hell, it's one thing to know about freight schedules, another thing to predict when the *market* will notice. It could crash tomorrow on bad first-quarter GDP numbers, or it might remain up until there are headlines about truckers unable to find work, or maybe it will take actual pictures of empty store shelves for the reality to sink in. And I certainly don't claim to know how badly the US will manage to drag the rest of the world economy down with it, which is why my money's in a mix of international stocks and international bonds, rather than simply one or the other.

What I can tell you is this: unfortunately, you can't assume surely *somebody* would do something about it, if there were a totally predictable crash incoming. Nobody else has as much of a financial interest in what happens to your savings as you do. Act accordingly.",458

1k8mm3o,2025-04-26 22:38:42,Reddit,investing,"TSLA, GOOGL",Sold all my Tesla shares before the crash. Here’s why I still think that was the right call (even at today's price),"A couple of months ago, prior to Tesla correcting by \~40% I no longer believed in the thesis of their stock valuation so I sold my entire holdings. Despite my continued admiration for Tesla’s tech, from an investment standpoint, I remain bearish—and it has little to do with the political horizon. Here’s why:

**Robotaxi: A Limited Revenue Catalyst**

Tesla plans to launch an unsupervised robotaxi service in Austin by mid-2025. However, even Tesla has admitted these vehicles will require human remote monitoring to ensure safety and regulatory compliance—a reality that adds cost and complexity.

The U.S. rideshare and taxi market today generates \~$52 billion annually, projected to grow to \~$61 billion by 2029. Capturing a meaningful slice of that pie won’t be easy:

* Waymo already operates fully autonomous fleets across Phoenix, San Francisco, LA, and Austin, and is expanding into Atlanta, Washington, Miami, and Tokyo.
* Pricing will be critical—and Tesla is playing catch-up technologically.

Even if Tesla somehow captured 25% of the entire U.S. market—a wildly optimistic scenario—it would generate \~$12 billion in revenue and $1–1.5 billion in profit over a decade or more.

More realistically, even under bullish forecasts, Tesla could earn \~$2 billion in revenue and \~$200 million in profit from robotaxis by 2029.

Compare that to Tesla’s current \~$80 billion revenue base.

It would move the needle by only a few percentage points—and that’s assuming everything goes perfectly.

Bottom line: this isn't a market-changing opportunity.

**Optimus: Exciting, But Decades Away From Prime Time**

Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot is expected to be priced around $20,000–$30,000. Elon Musk recently suggested a \~$30,000 target.

At that price, most consumers would expect meaningful labor-saving ROI within 3–5 years. Tasks like:

* Cooking
* Laundry
* Grocery management
* Lawn care and snow removal

However, today’s reality? Tesla’s current robots can walk, lift small objects, and wave awkwardly—nowhere near complex, unpredictable home environments.

Critical technical hurdles remain:

* Navigating messy, human-dominated spaces
* Handling fragile or variable items
* Making autonomous decisions (e.g., fridge organization, unexpected obstacles)

Without breakthroughs in sensing and manipulation—well beyond current camera-only perception—it will be years before these tasks are reliably automated. To make matters worse, Tesla is leveraging a camera-only approach versus their competitors who are technologically superior (and not just by a bit, exponentially)—leveraging LiDAR, radar, advanced depth, force and torque sensors, advanced tactile sensors and ultrasonic sensors. Boston Dynamics is easily 5-8+ years ahead of Tesla in this technological space.

Factory deployment of 10,000 Optimus units for repetitive assembly line tasks by year-end? Possible.

Household robots folding your laundry? Not this decade.

Musk’s historic promises around autonomy make cautious skepticism wise:

* 2014: ""90% of miles autonomous in 3 years.""
* 2016: ""LA to NYC trip without a single touch.""
* 2020: ""Level 5 autonomy this year.""

(Reality, of course, has been less obedient.)

So, while Optimus could shine in tightly controlled environments, it's unlikely to drive meaningful consumer or enterprise revenue before 2030.

**Tesla's Financial Trajectory: The Red Flags**

Tesla’s latest earnings report (Q1 2025) showed:

* 71% drop in net income year-over-year
* 9% decline in revenue
* 20% drop in automotive revenue
* Significant market share erosion in key markets

Without $595 million in regulatory credits, Tesla would have posted a $189 million net loss this quarter. The underlying trendlines are flashing yellow, if not red.

**Dark Pool Moves: Insider Games?**

Since earnings, Tesla has seen an explosive increase in dark pool trading volume—private institutional trades designed to mask large-scale buying or selling.

Coupled with decreased short interest and bullish options activity, it suggests a manufactured sentiment shift rather than organic investor enthusiasm.

In plain English: insiders are moving stealthily, likely repositioning ahead of retail reactions.

**Final Take**

Given the operational, technical, and competitive realities outlined above, I do not believe Tesla will achieve new revenue streams significant enough to materially impact its bottom line within the next 5 to 7 years.

Despite exciting tech demos, neither Robotaxi nor Optimus are poised to materially move Tesla’s bottom line within the next 5–7 years. Meanwhile, core auto sales are under pressure, and financial trends are deteriorating. Short-term market maneuvers may cause volatility, but the fundamentals do not justify long-term bullishness at today’s valuations.

**Fact Validation**

I made the decision to fact check myself with ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google) and Grok (X / Twitter). Here's the fact check:

Robotaxi

\- Tesla has said they will unveil the robotaxi vehicle in August 2024, aiming for service launch by 2025. Confirmed.

\- Remote monitoring is confirmed (source: Tesla earnings call Q1 2025). Confirmed.

\- U.S. taxi/rideshare market revenue: \~$52B in 2024, growing to \~$61B by 2029 (Statista and IBISWorld confirm this). Confirmed.

\- Waymo is indeed operational in Phoenix, SF, LA, and Austin, expanding into Atlanta, DC, Miami, and Tokyo (Waymo official updates April 2025). Confirmed.

\- Your assumption of 25% capture is very generous — Uber has >70% share vs. Lyft after a decade — so 25% for Tesla is very ambitious, making your $2B realistic even if optimistic. Confirmed.

\- Profit margins in rideshare: Uber's net margin is 2–5% despite scale. You're right that a \~$200M profit is realistic at best. Confirmed.

Optimus Robot

\- Elon has stated $20K–$30K target price range (source: Tesla AI Day, reinforced Q1 2025 call). Confirmed.

\- Musk acknowledged significant hurdles, particularly in object recognition and manipulation. Confirmed.

\- Tesla’s robot demos still show very basic tasks (walking, lifting objects), no complex home task automation yet. Confirmed.

\- Tesla historically overpromised autonomy timelines (you accurately documented Musk's timeline slip-ups — bravo). Confirmed.

\- Humanoid robot scaling into assembly line tasks is plausible, household use is years away. Confirmed.

Tesla Financials Q1 2025

\- 71% drop in net income: Confirmed.

\- 9% revenue decline: Confirmed.

\- Auto revenue down \~20%: Confirmed.

\- $595M regulatory credits: Confirmed. Without them, Tesla would have posted a net loss.

Dark Pool Activity

\- Post-earnings surge in dark pool activity is confirmed (based on trading desk reports and CBOE data). Confirmed.

\- Dark pools = private institutional trading. It’s correct to infer that sudden surges often signal insider repositioning. Confirmed.

1jdd2hh,2025-03-17 14:49:16,Reddit,investing,TSLA,Anatomy of gas lighting investors,"Trump Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, is worth about 500 million dollars.  During his tenure at Soros Fund Management he brought in over a billion dollars betting on the collapse of the British pound  (Black Wednesday), he also made out like a bandit betting on the collapse of the Yen.

He started his own investment firm, Key Square Group.  which did so badly they lost a ton of investors until the economic boom under Biden. His firm was very profitable 2021-2023.  The S&P under Biden gave us + 58% or so return or so (corrected).

He recently said what the Trump stock market tank is just an ordinary cycle, and that had we not prospered so much in 2006, 2007 we would not have had the ""market correction"" of 2008.  2008 was caused by deregulation and bad loans (amongst other things).   He is gaslighting investors and all Americans

He stands to make a ton of money from an impending recession.

Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, is an investment banker and worth between 2-4 billion dollars. He is on record saying Trump tariffs are ""worth it"" if they cause a recession. He has also said it's Biden's fault if we have a recession.

Biden oversaw the best economy we have seen in 50 years.

What these men have in common is both are bullshitting investors and all Americans.  Egg prices could go to $500 a dozen and they would buy the same amount of eggs they do now and not feel a thing.  They will also profit during a recession and they will be in  a great position to buy anything they want at cheap prices.

No telling how many White House insiders are shorting the S&P and other funds.

It's important that investors scrutinize the economy as well as those who are implementing policies that are degrading the market and realize when you are being gaslighted by those will profit from investor ignorance.

Finally, you hear a lot of noise these days with mindless cliches: ""timing the market"" or ""panic selling"" from people who are so gas lit you should avoid smoking around them to avoid combustion.

Buffet is sitting on more cash in the history of BRK and for a reason, and he has clearly said tariffs are not paid by the tooth fairy (they are paid by you and I).

The best thing an investor can do right now is understand fundamental economics and recognize when you are being gaslighted.  What you are seeing is not a market correction nor an ordinary cycle.  You're witnessing a very healthy market get tanked, and on purpose.

The irony is the market tries to love Trump.  They love his deregulation, low taxes for the rich and corporations, the end of red tape, etc.  The market loved his election win and we were seeing fresh highs.

Until he started his trade wars and threats to invade, and annex foreign countries.

Finally, both Trump and Elon have said it's going to be ""painful"" for a ""while"".  It will not be painful for them.  They will feel nothing, Trump has made hundreds of millions in the last few months off of his various grifts, Elon has tanked Tesla with his Nazi antics, but it's not like he's having to go to fewer movies or tighten his budget.

The robotaxi bet could pay off big

I was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.

Optimus robot could be the sleeper hit

The Optimus humanoid robot is another wild card that could transform Tesla's business model. They're planning to have thousands of units in production by year-end, ramping to potentially a million units annually by 2030. Imagine having one of these handling household chores, elder care, or factory work. The addressable market is potentially enormous if they can deliver even half of what they're promising.

I've been wrong before, but...

I sold half my position in 2022 thinking the Twitter acquisition would tank Tesla. Cost me about $40K in potential gains when it rebounded. The lesson I learned was that betting against Tesla's long-term vision because of short-term issues has consistently been a losing strategy.

But there's an enormous difference just among the top 10 tech stocks by size.

TSLA is trading at a PE of 177 which doesn't make the remotest bit of sense based on the business that they are in (cars) and could be in (robotaxis, robots, and AI), even if they were wildly successful in new business areas (in which they face stiff competition) there is no way to justify the current valuation.

PLTR's PE is over 600 not much more I need to say about that.

GOOG is trading at a PE of 21. Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.

AAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.

AMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.

MSFT's new leadership after the atrocious Ballmer has brought the company into huge new markets and they are well positioned to capitalize on AI, with a PE of 39 they are not cheap but by far not the most expensive with solid growth prospects.

I personally think that social media is a scourge upon the earth and is destroying the minds of young and old people alike, but META has essentially monopolies that will not be disrupted. 

Meanwhile these companies are investing nearly $300 billion in cap ex per year and have returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years. These aren't unprofitable ""dot com bubble"" stocks but entrenched cash cows.",96

I am noticing however that most companies are being priced correctly.

I am not talking about hyper exuberant companies (Tesla, Palantir...) but most blue chip stocks.   
Microsoft, Google, Visa, Mastercard (1.5-3% FCFY plus strong growth) .. but also less growth oriented companies like Pepsi, Kroger... (4-5% FCFY and a bit of growth)... Railways are more stable, so they trade between 3-5% FCY, are all trading around fair value IMO.

Actually I think the equity risk premium is a bit down and right know stocks are fairly priced with respect to treasuries (4-5% FCY, no growth). IMO there are still some attractive opportunities (bought uber last month), but the market is behaving quite well. 

Maybe this is the results of too much money in the system, desperately competing for limited assets, but I also think that people learning about the stock market (and flooding to ETFs) are making it more efficient, not less. 

I am not complaining, I think its ok that people are no longer over ridicolously cheap opportunities. Investing shouldn't be easy, so seeing fair prices is kind of good. Its not the mother of all bubbles, its actually fair that you don't make 15% per year while doing nothing. 

In short, congratulation to everybody that is consistently staying invested in the market, you are doing great and I am happy for you.

It kinda reminds me of how EV stocks were back in 2021. Tons of hype, massive valuations, and everyone trying to figure out who the real long term winners will be.

Back then, everyone thought every EV startup was gonna be the next Tesla. Now it feels like every company mentioning “AI” in an earnings call gets an automatic pump. A lot of these names have crazy forward P/Es considering how early the monetization still is.

I mean I'm pretty bullish on AI long-term, but it feels like there’s a lot of speculative money chasing short term narratives again. Some of these companies will end up being huge, but a lot probably won’t survive once the hype cools off.

1h9i57c,2024-12-08 13:47:50,Reddit,investing,TSLA,"I'm bullish on Rivian, and here is why.","Currently holding 65 shares, looking to round that out to 100 next pay period.  I am not a financial advisor, and this is not investment advice. I am simply sharing my thoughts. 

These are the things I will be watching this year, to continue to add to my position, or to see if I should reconsider my bullish sentiment. 

1. Nearing profitability.  Rivian has recently re-affirmed that by Q4 2024 we will be seeing gross profit per vehicle. They are expected to deliver just over 50,000 vehicles for the year. That is a combination of mostly R1S and R1T with some of the Amazon delivery vans. If there guidance is correct, and they either meet or beat q4 '24 earnings, it is a bullish sign.

  
2. $6 Billion loan from Uncle Sam. Now the new administration does create a bit of tension here.  The new ""DOGE"" agency is going to be cutting Gov. spending across the board. There is some concern they will take away this loan that the Biden administration had given to Rivian. While this is certainly a possibility, I do not think it is going to happen. I think it would be a very bad look politically, and would give strength to the argument musk will us his Gov. connections to attack his competitors. Because of that, I think this money is safely staying with Rivian.  If it turns out DOGE is going to back down from this threat, that is another bullish sign.

  
3. VW Rivian joint venture. VW NA is about to change, they are getting a new CEO, Kjell Gruner, who previously was the President and CEO of Porsche Cars of North America and then moved to Rivian to be there ""Chief Commercial Officer & President, Business Growth"".  VW desperatley needs software expertise, and Rivian delivers that in spades. That combined with VWs massive buying and production power, is a strong match. This is a bullish sign right now, and what I think has been pushing to stock upwards. 

VW has been hurting and their reputation is in the pits.  The introduction of the old/new Scout brand, that looks mighty similar to Rivians R2 concepts. As well as confirming the deal with Rivian, it looks like they're finally going to start to take serious steps to rebuilding their reputation, especially in NA. 

  
4. Rivians customers are happy, and according to a recent Consumer Reports Survey, 86% of owners say they would buy a Rivian again, better than Tesla. If they are happy with their purchase, they will talk to their other wealthy friends about their Rivian, word of mouth is very powerful.

  
5. The inevitable Tesla Comparison. RIVIAN IS NOT TESLA. Now obviously Tesla the company in 2024 is very different to Tesla the company in 2015. Back in 2015 it was the 3rd year of Model S production and the first of Model X. 

in 2015 Tesla sold just over 50,000 Model S. Now in 2023, just two years after the Rivian R1T debuted, Rivian sold just over 47,000 vehicles. I think Tesla in 2015 is more of a fair comparison to Rivian now in 2024, but Tesla now in 2024 is not so comparable to Rivian now in 2024.

  
I think Rivian makes a fantastic product, and there's a bright future ahead for them.",51

Also, reached my second goal of half a milli","I started investing in November 2017 and I was doing great during the bull run. Unfortunately everything crashed down in 2021 and I spent 3 years kicking myself thinking I should've just put everything on SPY and forget it. In the last few months I can finally say that my portfolio is beating the index again. At some point during December 2022 my portfolio was -35% while in comparison if I had put it on SPY I would still be positive. This traumatized me a bit and now that I am finally beating the index over the last 7.2 years I have three main thoughts:

1. Is the volatility worth it?  
2. I'm up on some names anything from 200-800% which makes them seem overvalued and makes me hesitate on buying more of those companies  
3. Feels like a 30%+ haircut can happen at any moment and Im just dreading when it comes.

Here's the dilemma I face. I firmly believe in long-term investing in S&P500 or Nasdaq100 index funds, and that's what I advise my clients to do for their retirement planning from their early age.

The problem arises with short- and medium-term investments. 

The more frequently my clients buy and sell individual stocks, the higher the fees I earn, which makes me wealthier. Leverage stocks like 3x tesla have much higher fees than index funds as you know.  

But clients who trade frequently tend to see lower returns over time. On the other hand, those who simply buy index funds consistently or hold onto blue-chip stocks like google or micorsoft for the long term usually achieve much better returns.

Of course, these long-term investors don’t generate as much revenue for me. Yet, I often find myself advising clients not to trade too often, even though I know this reduces my own income.

I can either do really well or or the complete opposite. And I was OK with losing the whole 30,000 if it came to it. By the time I finished my research, I had settled on a selection of stocks.

I was offered a managed portfolio with all the bells and whistles (tax strategy, etc.) for an annual fee of 0.89%.
Everything I read back when I did my research advised against my choices, and a lot of advice today would still argue against it. But I can’t deny that if I had listened, my portfolio would probably be one-fifth of what it is today.

1mypdyp,2025-08-24 09:38:05,Reddit,investing,"NVDA, TSLA, GOOGL",Trying to overhaul my IRA and taxable brokerage account with a focus on AI divestment,"I’m looking for a gut-check on a simple plan. I have an IRA (\~$80k) and a taxable brokerage (\~$267k) with Morgan Stanley. Both are managed accounts. Right now about 60% of the portfolio equity is effectively tied to big tech/AI (mag7). I’d like to cut that concentration, move to a fund-only setup, and keep costs low. Also somewhat of a hedge towards AI bubble burst.

Target mix (household level)

* 75% U.S. large cap
   * 50% core (S&P 500 or total market: VOO/VTI or equivalents)
   * 25% “top-7 light” allocation to reduce reliance on AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA (leaning XMAG; open to RSP if that’s cleaner)
* 25% diversifiers
   * 10% value (VTV or IWD)
   * 5% mid cap (VO or IJH)
   * 4% small cap (VB or IJR)
   * 6% international (VXUS or IXUS)

How I’d implement

* IRA: start with XMAG only (no S&P/total market in IRA) to cut the mega-cap tilt fast with no tax hit. 
* Taxable: keep the S&P/total-market core (VOO/VTI) and systematically exit all single-stock positions, prioritizing the big tech names first. Do it tax-sensitively with about $10–15k per year in realized gains, have dividends go to cash to fund the new ETFs, and aim to finish in roughly three years.

My rationale for this vs just holding S&P 500?

* Keeps broad U.S. exposure but dials down single-name risk.
* XMAG (or equal-weight) helps with the current top-heavy market.
* The diversifier slice is pretty boilerplate imo. 

Questions:

1. Does this combo (core + XMAG + value/mid/small/international) seem like a sensible way to cut big-tech exposure? Not a full divestment (though I'd like to - it's too risky of a bet), but a reduction in overexposure.
2. For placement, would you park value/mid/small in the IRA and leave international in taxable for the foreign tax credit, or is that not worth optimizing?
3. Is \~$10–15k per year in realized gains and a \~3-year glidepath a reasonable way to unwind single stocks in taxable?
4. End stage I'd like to remove the ""managed"" signifier from these two accounts entirely. Has anyone had luck asking for a reduced brokerage fee or flat/retainer model for the advisors? How would you recommend I broach this full strategy with them?
5. Should I deploy something similar with my 403b (if the available funds allow)?
6. Anything else I'm missing?",21

1nnfyrl,2025-09-22 09:24:22,Reddit,investing,TSLA,Why EnSilica is Worth Possibly 13x its Current Price (Updated),"Okay, so you are probably thinking… yeah right, here’s that degenerate Double Bubbler banging on about that penny stock again. Well take a brief moment and read the following to see why my opinion is not so outlandish. You may one day thank me for it.

EnSilica develops custom semiconductor chips called ASICs. Essentially dedicated silicon expertly designed to a particular task such as providing encryption for Internet of Things devices, or efficiently moving data across satellite networks as will hopefully soon be the case with their custom ASIC for AST Space Mobile.

Recently MDA Space acquired a relatively low profile Israeli firm Satixfy for $280m in an all cash offer. Satixfy being a competitor to EnSilica in the ASIC marketplace and high growth satellite communications industry, with 2024 revenue of $20.6m. So that acquisition price is over 13x last year’s revenue!

Compare that with EnSilica’s forecast FY25 revenue (to be confirmed in results anticipated next month) of approximately $25m to $27m as well as a forecast FY26 revenue of between $44m and $47m with ‘80% of FY 2026 revenue already covered by existing customer contracts’ according to EnSilica’s trading update on the London Stock Exchange in April. *Please note I have used the current FX rate to convert figures that were originally quoted by EnSilica in GBP.*

Consider also that another competitor of EnSilica’s is Filtronic who have significant contracts with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Given the importance of Filtronic’s ASICs to SpaceX it has formed a strategic alliance with the firm and acquired 10,949,079 warrants - 5% of the current share capital of Filtronic - which would give SpaceX the opportunity to acquire a notable stake in the firm. Why would it want that? Well in my opinion to ensure they could have a say in the future direction of the firm as well as perhaps giving them the opportunity to create a defensive position to fend off hostile takeovers of Filtronic.

On the subject of Filtronic it is worth considering their forward price-to-sales ratio compared to EnSilica’s. EnSilica trades at a forward PS of just over 1.12 (against the low end of their current FY26 forecast) which compares to Filtronic‘s forward PS of 5.3 according to Simply Wall St data. If EnSilica achieves a similar forward PS as it approaches it’s anticipated medium term sales projection of c.£100 per year (hopefully together with a healthy profit margin) then you could see a market capitalisation of £500m+. That’s 13.44 times the current share price.

Who do I think are likely contenders to acquire EnSilica? Well Qualcomm could be a prime candidate in my opinion. Or another large and diversified semiconductor manufacturer that appreciates and can take advantage of the breadth of EnSilica’s IP, not just the sat comm work but including the post quantum encryption chip, optical networking design IP and automotive radar IP which is being developed in tandem with Radareye following funding from a consortium including Transport for London, IAG and Admiral.

Another possibility is AST Space Mobile, who EnSilica signed a contract with for a high value satellite ASIC in 2021 and which I understand will be a core component within AST’s BlueBird Block 2 satellite constellation scheduled for launch in the coming year or so. I consider AST a possibility as I wouldn’t be surprised that over time they broaden their offering to more fully compete with SpaceX’s Starlink (e.g. higher bandwidth satellite comms with guaranteed quality of service via terminal devices for static and mobile situations). EnSilica has a suite of IP for satellite terminals (a market which is worth billions of dollars) and owning that IP could help AST better compete with Starlink in that scenario.

I can also see U.S. and European companies such as Boeing, Airbus or Thales taking interest, especially given plans for the European Union’s forthcoming IRIS2 constellation. EnSilica’s IP and talent would seemingly be of great benefit to various industry titans in the satellite communications race that is heating up rapidly.

While I would like to see EnSilica grow to become a future British tech champion, I could understand the management accepting an offer of approximately 13x FY26 revenue. With a notable holding myself, I would not complain either.

While EnSilica’s share price fell last week, I still have immense conviction in this promising company and my recent discussion with Chairman Mark Hodgkins has only given me additional confidence in its future long term potential.

Yes, the share price may be turbulent in the times ahead however I may accumulate further should weakness persist (as I did last week) or following what I feel is an unlikely near term event, a rights issue, as is rumoured on ADVFN for example. 

EnSilica is a company I intend to hold for the years ahead given their apparent trajectory as well as potential for being acquired at a significant multiple to its current value.

May fortune favour the brave!",14
1ny8yig,2025-10-05 01:32:37,Reddit,investing,TSLA,Do stock valuation metrics matter?,"Hi, I'm new to investment from EU.

I recently learned about stock valuation measures such as P/B, P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and more. However, I started to feel like these traditional stock valuation metrics do not really provide useful insights in fast-growing companies nowadays and which one to invest. For instance, the current stock price valuations on tech companies such as Tesla, Palantir, Nebius, AST Space, and IonQ are not justified by the metrics IMO. It seems like to me that the majority of the tech companies have very high premium price solely judged by the valuation metrics. Perhaps, it's just all about the AI, EV, and future technology hype, but their stock prices have been growing fast long enough even though people pointed out they are overvalued years ago. I don't think that professional investors are dumber than some random dudes using yahoo finance or seeking alpha and ignore all those numbers...  

As I see, qualitative properties (e.g, market trend, product outlook) have much stronger influence on the stock price. I'm not sure if I should be less concerned about the metrics and be more focused on what company does and the current market trend.

1ixvmn7,2025-02-25 14:59:51,Reddit,investing,"NVDA, TSLA, GOOGL",The Bull Case for Xpeng ($XPEV),"**Why Xpeng stock ($XPEV) can 5x to hit US$100 (and beyond?) by end-2026**

Below is a condensed report, drop me a PM if you want to know more. Also, if China stocks are not your thing, either risk-, political-, personal-, or other-wise, kindly ignore. I was not paid or sponsored to write this and do not have glowing EV or AI credentials, but I have been diligently researching and studying the EV industry (including Xpeng) since 2020.

**INTRODUCTION**

Xpeng is a Chinese EV maker headed by CEO He Xiaopeng, with dual listings in the USA and Hong Kong. Its current price as of today is around US$19.5 with a market capitalization of around US$18.6 billion.

But is it really just an automaker? I’d argue Xpeng is in fact a software company providing full-stack AI mobility solutions, and seems hugely underestimated by analysts and markets alike. Here’s why Xpeng could see large growth in the coming years, perhaps hitting US$100 by end-2026 (or \~US$100 billion market cap), using a simple SWOT analysis.

**STRENGTHS** 

1. **Product & Design:** Xpeng’s cars have always had aesthetics in mind, with their latest P7+ and sub-brand MONA M03 sedans’ stylish looks, best-in-class comfort, and large space now huge bestsellers in China. Xpeng is now the 3rd best selling EV carmaker in China at the moment, behind BYD, Wuling, and Geely.
2. **Affordability:** Xpeng cars are kept affordable while retaining many luxury and tech features, providing good value-for-money.
3. **Cutting-edge Technology & Features:** Outstanding Xpeng tech includes an in-house powertrain integrated with the vehicle chassis, plus outstanding autonomous driving capabilities and smart features.
4. **Strong Leadership Team:** In 2023, CEO Xiaopeng and President Wang Fengying overhauled the management team, rooted out corruption, eradicated departmental inefficiencies, and shifted to a more user-centric focus. The CEO remains humble and fully committed to building the company to reach greater heights.
5. **Strong Supply Chain, Marketing & Branding Management:** After a tumultuous 2022 and 2023, Xpeng’s product, marketing, and supply chain teams are now all working harmoniously to swiftly ramp up production and deliver blockbuster hits one after another.
6. **Financials:** The [CEO has recently hinted at a breakeven quarter this year](https://cnevpost.com/2025/02/07/xpeng-expects-break-even-single-quarter-2025/), which will be a pivotal turning point for the company and change in valuation metrics.

**WEAKNESSES**

1. **Low Brand Strength & Perception:** Xpeng is slowly but surely growing its reputation in China and overseas, with stronger sales.
2. **Intense Industry Competition & Price Wars Creating Margin Erosion:** Might not necessarily be a weakness since competition breeds innovation and efficiency (see Deepseek). Moreover, Xpeng has several cost advantages, such as Gigapresses and joint raw materials purchases with partner Volkswagen.

**OPPORTUNITIES** 

1. **Strong 2025 Pipeline:** 2025 official target deliveries is 380–400,000. However looking at their strong pipeline, especially for L3 autonomous driving, I am forecasting 450–500,000 deliveries for this year, with a possibility of attaining 800,000+ EV deliveries for 2026.
2. **Autonomous Driving (AD) & Self Driving Cars:** Xpeng is a strong contender for this race, with the CEO declaring in January 2025 they will achieve Quasi-L3 AD by mid-2025 and Full L3 AD by end of 2025.
3. **Flying Cars:** Xpeng’s Land Aircraft Carrier (modular van and flying eVTOL module) will start deliveries in 2026 (no, this is not a wild going-by-faith projection, the [factory is currently under construction with target completion in 3Q 2025](https://cnevpost.com/2024/10/27/xpeng-aeroht-flying-car-base-breaks-ground/)). Their entry will shake up the low-altitude economy due to its mass production capabilities, cost advantages, and synergies with EV production and technology. But don't expect this business to have a huge impact on the stock by itself.
4. **Humanoid Robots:** Xpeng’s bipedal, all-purpose Iron Robots have already been deployed in Xpeng’s factories and stores, and are expected to enter trial commercial use in the second half of 2025, meaning commercial use may come in 2026, including **talking and moving like humans.** Much potential in this enormous space for Xpeng, which has several differences in its robot tech from its peers (with the CEO just saying he is confident [Xpeng will deploy one of the earliest mass-produced L3 robots in China](https://m.weibo.cn/status/5137890441693096)).
5. **AI Car Chips:** Xpeng will mass-produce their potentially game-changing Turing AI chip in mid-2025 (3x the computing power of industry standard Nvidia's Drive Orin-X), where it will set off a chain motion of new product launches. Possible to be adopted by other automakers too. Angus McKenzie from Motortrend has speculated that if Xpeng’s Turing Chip lives up to its full potential, it could be a [Deepseek moment for the car industry](https://www.motortrend.com/news/xpeng-develops-ai-chip-deepseek-moment/). 
6. **Robocars & Robotaxis:** The final step in autonomous driving (L4/L5 AD), and with endless possibilities: From transportation to food delivery to mobile convenience stores to F&B to ecommerce deliveries. Coupled with Iron Robot can achieve wonders in any industry.
7. **Global Expansion:** Xpeng car sales are accelerating around the world, with a targeted presence in 60 countries by end of 2025, compared to 30 as of end 2024.
8. **Increasing Partnerships & Institutional Investors:** Existing partnerships and investments by Volkswagen may deepen, and institutional investors (domestic or foreign) may start to invest in Xpeng as it becomes recognized worldwide.

**THREATS** 

1. **Competition:** There is always intense **price competition** in the EV sector, whether in China or overseas. However, Xpeng is in a sweet spot of value for money and product, and will continue to attract customers in the entry-level range. **Competition in autonomous driving** is fierce, and there’s a chance another car company unlocks L3 and L4 before Xpeng. However, Xpeng will get there eventually too, and it has other prospects, plus it can always catch up and outshine with its robocar offerings. Some may also be worried that **copycats** will mimic Xpeng’s popular car models bolt for bolt, but it’s not so simple as Xpeng has built up a decade’s worth of proprietary innovation and expertise in building cutting-edge EVs. And will continue to do so.
2. **Loss of Innovation:** Xpeng depends heavily on its tech innovation to stand out. Loss of key men may cause a brain drain and loss of technological edge. Xpeng is tackling this by recruiting the best and brightest, and heavily invested in R&D.
3. **Geopolitical Tensions:** I believe a **major war is very unlikely** under the current Trump administration. But increasing friction between USA and China may spark another call for **delisting of China ADRs**, which if comes to pass will create volatility in the stock prices, but I feel Xpeng’s stock will eventually recover and push higher as the company performs well (will have small forex risk though). USA may also decide to **tighten EV chip restrictions** on China automakers, but that will not affect Xpeng as it transitions to its own Turing Chip for all its products in mid-2025 (may turn out to be a boon instead as competitors falter).
4. **Global or Domestic Economic Softness:** Any economic slowdown in China or the rest of the world will have a mixed effect on Xpeng’s position as an affordable, mass market, smart EV brand. A slowdown could actually spur more consumers to go for bang-for-their-buck cars, and Xpeng fits the bill perfectly.

**SUMMARY**

Do you want to own a company that can potentially change the world? Xpeng could turn out to be the **Tesla of China, Figure AI of China, Archer Aviation of China, Nvidia of Cars: All rolled into one!**

The risk reward looks tremendously positive. And the worst case I can see right now is the stock goes sideways due to inexplicable stagnation in its domestic and overseas EV car business, PLUS all its other exciting prospects — Autonomous Driving, Flying Cars, AI Chips, Robots, Robocars — fall flat.

BUT, in a good scenario (not necessarily the best case even), if one or two of Xpeng’s businesses blast off? A review of each and my estimated valuations (now and end-2026, with estimated annual sales):

1. **EV Cars (Semi-AD)** — Current (**L2 AD**, 300K annual sales): US$18 Billion | End 2026 (**L3 AD**, 800K-1M sales + huge/growing orderbook): US$50–60 Billion *(Benchmarked against BYD & Li Auto valuation)*
2. **Flying Cars** — Current (3K orderbook): US$1 Billion | End 2026 (10K sales + 10–30K orderbook, depends on type): US$5–20 Billion *(*[*Benchmarked against Archer Aviation valuation*](https://investors.archer.com/news/news-details/2024/Archer-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-Demonstrating-Manufacturing-Certification-and-Commercial-Launch-Momentum/default.aspx)*)*
3. **Robots** — Current: Nil | End 2026 (5–10K sales + 10–100K orderbook): US$5–60 Billion *(Wildcard, Enormous potential,* [*Benchmarked against Figure AI valuation*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/robotics-startup-figure-ai-in-talks-for-new-funding-at-39-5-billion-valuation)*)*
4. **AI Chips** — Current: Nil | End 2026 (0–20K orderbook + partnerships): US$2–20 Billion *(Big wildcard at the moment)*
5. **Robocars (Full-AD)** — Current: Nil | End 2026 (10–50K orderbook + partnerships): US$5–40 Billion *(Enormous potential,* [*Benchmarked against Waymo & Tesla valuation*](https://www.barrons.com/articles/alphabet-waymo-stock-tesla-robotaxis-29a57e01) *with big haircut)*

Is this so ridiculous? Bear in mind Tesla’s sky high valuation for its future autonomous driving, robot, and robocar plays. Now Xpeng is valued at a mere 1.8% of Tesla. A major product breakthrough can trigger a sharp bull run for Xpeng, cause short-sellers to stay away, and maybe turn it into a meme stock. Just my 2 cents. Peace out.",7

In 2024, I decided to try a simple but consistent investment experiment: I invested **€10 per week** in the ""Magnificent 7"" (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, NVDA, TSLA, and META). The goal was to understand how regularity and patience could yield results. I confess that I rebalanced twice, but I can’t remember when exactly (oops!).

This wasn’t my only investment, and its sole purpose was to see how it would perform over the course of a year. It’s not an allocation I plan to keep in the future.

**Results**:

* I invested a total of **€520** throughout the year.
* The current portfolio value is **€706.80**, which means a profit of **€186.80** (+35.92% return).

**Key Takeaways**:

* **Consistency works:** Investing small amounts regularly helps avoid timing the market. DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) for the win!
* **Stock selection matters:** The ""Magnificent 7"" are heavily exposed to the tech sector, which had a strong year, but that also means higher volatility.
* **Patience is key:** I didn’t touch the investments throughout the year, and that was crucial for these results.

This was a personal experiment that helped me learn more about the impact of regular investing and how the market can reward those who stick to a disciplined strategy.

It’s just my experience—not right, not wrong—just mine, and I wanted to share it with you!

1ju68ef,2025-04-08 07:32:25,Reddit,investing,TSLA,How China’s Restrictions on Rare Earth Mineral Exports would Affect the EV Industry,"China’s restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, notably tightened as of April 4, 2025, are poised to significantly impact the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) industry. Rare earths like neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium are essential for the high-performance magnets in EV motors, while elements like lanthanum are used in batteries. China controls roughly 60-70% of global rare earth mining and nearly 90% of processing, giving it a chokehold on the supply chain that the U.S. EV sector heavily relies on.
The immediate effect is supply disruption. The U.S. imports about 74% of its rare earths from China (down from 80% a decade ago), and with export controls escalating—starting with gallium, germanium, and graphite in 2023 and expanding to other rare earths in 2024 and 2025—manufacturers like Tesla, General Motors, and Ford could face shortages. A single EV motor can require 1-2 kilograms of rare earth magnets, and with U.S. EV sales projected to hit 1.5-2 million units annually by 2030, the demand for these materials is massive. Without a steady supply, production lines could slow or halt, delaying deliveries and driving up costs.
Cost increases are already in motion. Post-restriction price spikes have historical precedent: in 2011, when China cut exports, rare earth prices soared—neodymium hit $67,000 per metric ton. Recent data shows neodymium at $75,097 per metric ton and dysprosium up 4.65% to $250.60 per kilogram as of late 2024, with analysts expecting further climbs in 2025 due to these bans. EVs already use six times more minerals than conventional cars, and with graphite (another restricted mineral) being the largest component in battery anodes (up to 136 pounds per EV), battery prices could jump 18% or more, pushing sticker prices higher and potentially slowing consumer adoption.
Geopolitical leverage amplifies the strain. China’s moves are a response to U.S. tariffs and tech curbs, like the Biden administration’s December 2024 semiconductor export limits. With 90% of heavy rare earths (like dysprosium, critical for EV motor heat resistance) processed in China, a full ban could cripple production timelines. The U.S. has only one active rare earth mine—Mountain Pass in California—producing 15% of global supply, but it lacks sufficient domestic processing capacity. MP Materials, the operator, ships much of its output to China for refining, and its Fort Worth magnet facility won’t be fully online until late 2025 at earliest.
Mitigation efforts are underway but slow. The U.S. is investing in domestic supply chains—Biden’s 2021 Executive Order 14017 and the Inflation Reduction Act pump millions into mining and recycling—but scaling up takes years. Alternatives like Australia (10% of global supply) or Vietnam exist, but their output is dwarfed by China’s, and processing still often routes through Chinese facilities. Recycling could offset 30% of future rare earth demand, yet only 1% is currently recycled in the U.S. Tesla’s shift away from rare earths in next-gen motors is promising, but it’s not yet scalable across the industry.
The EV industry faces a triple hit: delayed production, higher costs, and strategic vulnerability. A total graphite ban alone could slash EV output, given China’s 77% share of natural graphite and 95% of synthetic graphite production. Add rare earth curbs, and the U.S. could lose ground in the global EV race, with economic losses estimated at $3.4 billion in GDP from just gallium and germanium restrictions. Without rapid diversification or innovation, China’s restrictions could stall America’s electric dreams.

* Uber’s stock is currently undervalued due to market fears surrounding autonomous vehicles, but its robust fundamentals and durable business model make it a highly appealing investment.
* Key strengths include an extensive urban mobility database, loyal user base, and diversified sources of revenue.
* While the rise of self-driving technology presents certain risks, Uber’s strategic alliances, regulatory challenges for competitors, and market dominance ensure it remains well-positioned for sustained growth.
* Even cautious revenue and margin projections suggest considerable upside potential, making Uber an attractive choice with a strong margin of safety.

**The Impact of Market Narratives on Uber's Perception**

Recent announcements have reignited interest in autonomous driving. Tesla (TSLA) revealed plans to launch the Cybercab by 2027, while Google’s Waymo (GOOGL) announced expansion into Miami. These updates have led to a nearly 10% drop in Uber’s stock, contributing to a 15% decline over the past month.

This situation is reminiscent of past market narratives that impacted companies like Google and Meta (META). Both experienced temporary valuation drops due to overblown concerns but ultimately delivered strong returns, supported by solid fundamentals and competent management.

Uber continues to showcase impressive operational growth, strong cash flow, and consistent profitability, all while trading at historically low P/E multiples. These attributes, combined with its moat-driven business model, position Uber as a promising portfolio addition.

**Uber's Competitive Moats and the Importance of Strategic Management**

Uber’s advantages go beyond its network effects. Its unmatched urban mobility database allows for optimized routing, pricing, and seamless connections between users and drivers. Additionally, features like loyalty programs, subscriptions, and brand trust further enhance its competitive position in a sector where reliability and safety are crucial.

Diversification is another critical element in reducing risk. Similar to Google’s evolution beyond search, Uber has created a multifaceted platform that includes logistics and transportation. Delivery accounted for 30% of revenue in Q3, while freight contributed 11%, generating $1.3 billion despite not yet achieving positive EBITDA margins. These emerging segments have the potential to become significant revenue drivers in the future.

Furthermore, Uber’s investments in companies like Grab (GRAB) and DiDi (OTCPK:DIDIY) reflect a strategic approach to balancing profitability and competition. These equity stakes act as a form of optionality while demonstrating Uber’s ability to focus on long-term gains in key regions.

Uber’s management has shown remarkable capability in adapting to industry changes. Much like Meta’s successful redirection of investments, Uber is already positioning itself for the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Partnerships with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta exemplify its ability to integrate self-driving technology while retaining its platform leadership.

**Adapting to Regulations and Long-Term Mobility Trends**

The adoption of self-driving vehicles faces significant hurdles, including regulatory and infrastructure challenges, particularly in emerging markets that are critical to Uber’s business. While major cities like Los Angeles and Miami may adopt autonomous technology sooner, broader implementation is likely to take years, especially in regions such as Brazil, India, and Mexico.

In addition, overarching trends in urban mobility—including cost savings, easing traffic congestion, and the shift from ownership to access—support Uber’s long-term growth. Although the global ride-hailing market is already substantial, it remains underpenetrated in numerous regions, providing opportunities for continued expansion.

**Uber's Resilience Shines Even in Pessimistic Scenarios**

While autonomous vehicles pose potential risks, competition from local apps and evolving regulations may present more immediate challenges to Uber’s margins and market share. Nonetheless, analysts project Uber’s EPS to reach $4 by 2027 and $4.80 by 2028, resulting in P/E multiples of 15x and 12.8x, respectively.

Even under conservative assumptions, Uber’s revenue could exceed $74 billion by 2030, with margins reaching 11.5%. In a more optimistic outlook, margins of 17% would result in a P/E multiple around 10x, equating to an earnings yield of 10%—a compelling figure for a leader in a growing market.

Uber’s forward P/E and free-cash-flow multiples of 21.9x remain attractive given its growth trajectory and low current valuations. With management forecasting strong EBITDA growth and robust free-cash-flow conversion, Uber offers significant upside even if its market valuation remains steady.

**TLDR:** Uber’s long-term outlook remains favorable despite concerns over disruption from self-driving technology. Its diversified operations, strategic investments, and adaptability effectively mitigate potential risks. At its current valuation, Uber represents a strong investment opportunity with substantial potential for long-term shareholder returns.

1hcqtr1,2024-12-12 18:51:03,Reddit,investing,TSLA,Returning to active stock portfolio management,"I recently decided to return to active stock portfolio management after my first attempt ended somewhat disastrously. To reconcile this experience and entertain others, I want to reflect on the mistakes I made and the new approaches I’ve adopted.

But first, briefly, the story of my initial failure.

When I started managing my portfolio, I quickly learned about the S&P 500 but was convinced I was smart enough to outperform the market. Arrogance was one of the main reasons for my downfall.

In 2019, I flirted with Bitcoin, which initially delivered great returns. Encouraged by the hype, I also invested heavily in PaySafe shortly after its IPO, believing in its potential because “everyone” said it was going to be great. At the same time, I was doing a lot of day trading. Looking back, I realize I wasn’t trading rationally. I’d look at graphs and invest simply because I felt the price would go up. I was taking desirable outcomes for granted.

Although I made a few conservative and reasonable investments, their success couldn’t offset the losses caused by Bitcoin’s decline, PaySafe’s terrible performance, and my risky trading. After 18 months, my portfolio was down 40%.

The arrogance I started with made the loss feel devastating. I abandoned my investment account for several years.

When I returned to it a year ago, I discovered that the growth of my conservative investments, along with Bitcoin’s recovery, had boosted my portfolio to 20% growth from my initial investment. I sold everything and bought into the S&P 500, feeling that I wasn’t capable of picking good stocks and should leave that to the fund. This turned out to be a good action, as the S&P 500 performed very well this year.

Now, I feel I’ve learned from my mistakes and am ready to approach active investing again. 

To avoid repeating the same mistakes, I’ve set specific rules to guide me:

1. I Avoid Speculative Investments
I now steer clear of speculative assets like crypto, IPO stocks, or companies like Tesla. I want to be a disciplined investor, keeping my greed under control.  

2. I Reject Market Timing
I no longer believe in timing the market but instead focus on time in the market. I avoid trying to “buy low today and sell high tomorrow” because it’s too easy to confuse wishful thinking with reality. Paying attention to micro events can help to take advantage of daily fluctuations, but it requires too much time and still, offers uncertain outcomes. More often than not, it doesn’t pay off.

3. Focus on Debt-to-Equity
In the past, I ignored the debt-to-equity ratio. Now, I prioritize companies with consistent net income and manageable debt levels.

4. Limit Individual Stock Exposure
I cap my individual stock picks at 5% of my total portfolio. Previously, this rule would have forced me to find 20 or more stocks to invest in, leading to choosing assets that were just “okay” rather than ones I genuinely liked. Thankfully, with most of my portfolio now in the S&P 500, individual stock picks act as a good supplement rather than a replacement for the index.

5. Invest in Goods and Services I Value
My approach to stock selection has shifted. I now look for companies whose products and services I personally interact with and consider them of great value. If the companies also demonstrate strong financial performance and maintain a reasonable debt-to-equity ratio, they become my choice.

I hope these rules will help me sleep well at night, keep me from obsessing over financial news, and generate decent returns that complement the S&P 500.",4

Previously been 100% in crypto and it’s time to get a bit less volatile and more traditional in my investment strategy. I’m new to this, so help me out. I’m 30, looking for medium low risk, and plan to hold long term, minimum 10years, max 30. I want simplicity, growth, stability, and to be confident in my holdings. Here’s my portfolio set up:

Brokerage 
- 50% VOO
- 20% QQQM
- 10% NVDA
- 10% GOOG
- 10% TSLA

The individual stocks are ones I believe in and want extra exposure too, yes not simple and there’s overlap, but I’m confident in them. 

Roth IRA
- 75% VTI
- 25% SCHD

I could do more growth in Roth, but I just love the SCHD dividend dopamine and “game” of trying to accumulate SCHD. Even though it may not be optimal for growth, it feels good.

1hfprfx,2024-12-16 19:26:39,Reddit,investing,TSLA,Savings Diversity - General Questions,"So I have a general question about the cash that I'm keeping on hand.

I have about 40K in savings right now. Here is the breakdown:

33K in a HYS (3.8 APY)

6K in a different HYS (6.5 APY but I can only add 2K per month so I have an automatic transfer from the 3.8 account into this one. Every year the money all gets kicked out in August so it's a constant cycle)

$750 initially invested right now (650 in VTI/VOO ETFS - 100 in Tesla Stock)

I have about 13k in retirement as well (70% low risk 30% moderate risk)

Should I have more of my money invested into S&P ETFs that would likely outpace the 3.9 HYS? What do you think my diversity should be between all of these options? Are there other options I should look into?",3

I pretty much want an index fund like VOO minus a few stocks such as APPL, TSLA, MSTR (especially TSLA and MSTR). Idealy a financial institution would provide a bunch (500+) check boxes for each compaany (sorted by market cap) where by default it buys the same fraction of each stock.

Essentially I want to create a custom index fund where my custom fund has almost every notable company in the USA or the world. I like being lazy and do not want to buy 500+ stocks ever time I get a paycheck.

From googling around there are services that offer something called ""direct indexing"" but I don't see why buying / selling a market proportional ammount should cost 0.4% / year. I also do not understand why there would need to be ""rebalancing"" since ETFs such as VOO own (throwing out a number) 5% of everything and buy / sell as people buy / sell the ETF.",2

1hiq21y,2024-12-20 19:18:36,Reddit,investing,TSLA,"Every Monday morning I invest $1,885. Here is how I divvy it up, can y'all provide feedback/opinions on my investing strategy please?","I'm an early 30s single guy with a solid income. I invest $1885.00 every week which amounts to roughly half of my take home pay, and I live off the other half.

I live in a very high cost of living city and I rent an apartment. I've got a very long time horizon so I'm trying to be aggressive.

Here is how I divvy my money:

S&P 500 ETF (VOO) | $700 | 37.14%
NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) | $400 | 21.22%

**TOTAL** | $1885 | 100%

*The difference between XLF and IAI is that XLF is mostly financial services such as JP Morgan Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, Wells Fargo etc..., whereas IAI is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Schwab, S&P Global etc... There is only a 15% overlap between these two ETFs.

**The 15 companies I like that I invest $15 each into are: Adobe (ADBE), AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Chipotle (CMG), Salesforce (CRM), Door Dash (DASH), Netflix (NFLX), ServiceNow (NOW), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Palantir (PLTR), Shopify (SHOP), Sofi Bank (SOFI), Uber (UBER)

---

I think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

I'm open to feedback from others. I'm trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why I invest in the Mag 6 and the 15 companies I like, while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 58.36% of my money in the S&P and Nasdaq, getting small cap exposure, exposure to the financial sector so that I am not exclusively in tech, and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities (even though technically this is a stock that tracks the price of bitcoin, it is 100% linked to bitcoin).

1juwpro,2025-04-09 05:46:10,Reddit,investing,"NVDA, TSLA",Crude oil an investment with price floor,"With most investments, they have an effective price floor of zero. 
Nvidia, Tesla, GM, BAC any company can go to zero over night but because of the intrinsic self balancing feature of oil price as controlled by OPEC and non-OPEC members. 

Crude oil has a price floor because the producers all have a breakeven price that if it goes under, they all start losing money so they reduce output and bring their price back up. 

For US shale producers in the Permian Basin, that's around $60bbl. For the UAE that's $59bbl. Qatar is $42. 

Right now WTI is at a 52 week low of $62. If it drops another $2 a lot of US producers are gonna start losing money. 

Even with the recession risk that'll drop demand, the suppliers will correspondingly drop supply to keep prices stable. 

As soon as the economy picks back up again, the crude oil price will increase. 

Oil producers can and will go bankrupt but oil will always come back. ",2
1l39c6h,2025-06-04 18:01:21,Reddit,investing,TSLA,Argument for the P/E ratio new paradigm,"This is pure intuitive speculation, I will appreciate all corrections and counter arguments! :) 


Current P/E ratios for the US large and ultra-large cap stocks are very high and looking back at history, many people (myself included) wonder if it's still worth it to keep passively investing in them. It appears that the P/E ratios are 'out of balance' and will have to come back down sooner than later. This would supposedly most likely happen by P going down. 


I am well aware of bubbles, talk of new paradigms, confirmation bias, irrational exuberence and all that good and valid jazz. 


Despite that, I can't help but feel like there are trends causing inflows of money into assets to increase and compound over time, trends which likely explain recent (decade) huge price increases and will likely continue into the future, further 'skewing' asset valuations and P/E ratios.


More people are buying assets than ever. Demand for assets, return on invesfment is increasing. Rich people get richer, want to spend their money to get richer, and number of rich people is increasing. For example, Amrericans' stock ownership is at an ATH. https://kanebridgenews.com/more-americans-than-ever-own-stocks/
I suspect a similar picture for the entire world for all asset classes. Demand for assets is increasing faster than supply of assets.*


Global GDP continues to grow, likely reflecting rising disposable incomes, purchasing power. Due to  diminishing returns' on consumption, more and more people allocate more and more of their disposable income to investments/assets (crude example: once all billionaires get 3 superyachts, most will not want to buy a 4th, instead they will have to put their money somewhere else. Most attractive option for spare money are assetd. There are only so many consumables to go around and the demand for them is not infinite unlike demand for returns on investment aka assets (and blue chip stocks are some of the most attractive assets).


Share of incomes going into investments increasing, means share of incomes going into consumption decreases. Consumption roughly is E. Company earnings are not keeping up because people consume fewer and fewer of their products instead opting to put more money into their shares (for example, there is more demand for Tesla shares than Tesla cars, if I may say so). This seems like a very rational decision on the individuals' part and ever reflectd common financial advice.


So, assuming demand for money stays as high as now (likely because humans evolved to want more resources than everyone around them), these trends will continue. Thus we would expect in the long term stock valuations to keep increasing (obviously with short term violatility) even without corresponding increase in their earnings. 


* For example it's much easier to simply earn money with a job than to create a company providing jobs. Automation. It's easier to earn enough to buy an asset than to build one?

1lhul3c,2025-06-22 20:14:37,Reddit,investing,"NVDA, TSLA",Advice about ethical investing?,"
So, for context, I’m from Spain and almost 30. I started investing around two years ago, when I didn’t really know how it worked. My biggest investment was my current house, which I bought for around 200,000€, and I’ve also put some money into the stock market sporadically (around 3,000€ total), investing in the classics like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Coca-Cola, by buying individual stocks through Revolut, not funds or ETFs. 

I never invested in Tesla, Netflix, and some other companies because they go against my values (Elon Musk, subscription services, gas or arms companies, etc.). But over time, I’ve realized that many of the companies I have invested in don’t align with my morals either, especially after some of them publicly supported Trump (Meta, Amazon, etc.) or Israel (Carrefour, McDonald’s, and many more).

Now I’m dealing with an internal conflict. I want to make money, but not by supporting unethical companies. I’ve noticed that a lot of funds and ETFs also include these companies in different proportions, and the ones that don’t often don’t perform well. So it’s hard to find ways to invest that feel both profitable and principled.

I guess my questions are: how do you align your values with your investments? Do you think there’s a middle ground, and if so, how do you find it? Do you have any recommendations for specific companies, funds, or ETFs that are both ethical and profitable? Or would it make more sense to put the money into a high-yield savings account, crypto, gold, or something else?

All feedback is welcome.

1jzifew,2025-04-15 05:48:45,Reddit,StockMarket,TSLA,Forget tariffs. The real war is happening in the bond market.,"

While everyone was watching headlines about chip exemptions and auto tariff “pauses,” the actual battlefront quietly shifted to something much more serious U.S. Treasuries.

China has begun selling off U.S. government bonds, and this week the yield on the 10-year surged above 4.5%. That’s not just volatility it’s a red flag. For those unfamiliar: bond yields go up when demand drops. And the 10-year is the backbone of global risk pricing.

Historically, when stocks drop, bonds rally they’re the safe haven. But not now. Stocks are falling. Bonds are falling. That’s not “normal” even Barclays titled their client note: “This is not normal.”

Why it matters?

    1. China is signaling it’s done playing nice. Selling Treasuries isn’t just diversification it’s a geopolitical move.
 2. If Europe joins the sell-off (and some signs suggest they might), this becomes more than a warning it’s a structural unraveling of confidence in U.S. fiscal stability.
3. Every long red candle you see? That’s not panic over tariffs or Tesla’s margins that’s institutional capital quietly stepping off the table.

Sure, the market bounced on Friday. But don’t let that fool you these rebounds are like spasms in a body under shock. The fundamental shift is already underway. No tweet will stop it. Not even one from the king of tariffs himself.

The U.S. can’t keep applying band-aids with election-year PR while the world begins to hedge against the dollar and U.S. debt. So if you’re wondering why “good news” isn’t saving the market anymore it’s because the people who move this market have already left the room.

Update: Yes the sell-off isn’t typical. We saw a similar move back in 2018, when Russia sharply reduced its U.S. Treasury holdings it was visible in the TIC reports with a sudden $80B drop. They used custodial accounts in Belgium, masking direct attribution at first.

Now we see similar behavior: yields are rising fast without major domestic triggers, and China just halted rare earth exports a clear geopolitical signal. Add to that the drop in FX reserves and quiet USD accumulation by the PBoC this points to China likely selling Treasuries.

1jgemo3,2025-03-21 12:29:37,Reddit,StockMarket,TSLA,What Happens When a Mag 7 Brand Becomes Political🤢🤮💥,"WSJ—Michael Hanna once admired Elon Musk so much that Tesla stock made up about 25% of his portfolio. But in February, put off by the chief executive’s behavior as part of the Trump administration, Hanna sold the last of his shares.

Hanna, a data architect in Washington state, considers himself politically independent and supports some of the goals that Musk and President Trump have pursued, such as trimming the federal budget and reviving American manufacturing. But he has been bewildered by Musk’s chainsaw-waving leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency, which he called “chaotic.” Controversy surrounding Musk is bad for Tesla sales, he said.

“I think the brand is irreparably damaged at this point,” Hanna said.

Just a few months ago, investors were betting that a second Trump administration would be great news for Tesla. Instead, the longtime stock-market highflier has plummeted in 2025. Shares have fallen more than 40% this year, erasing about $536 billion in market value. The stock is on track for a nine-week streak of losses—its longest on record. 

Part of that decline stems from investors’ broad retreat from the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks that drove markets higher last year. Worries about economic growth and Trump’s trade fights have driven declines in some of the market’s biggest gainers. Tesla’s business has also faced unique challenges. Competition has increased while sales have faltered; on Thursday, the company recalled most Cybertrucks because an exterior panel might fall off and endanger motorists. 

But Musk’s role in the administration has repelled some of the fans who helped popularize Tesla cars and make the stock one of Wall Street’s hottest trades. For some, mass firings of federal workers are the issue, while others are concerned with his social-media posts or just think he is too distracted with government business to run Tesla. Protesters have demonstrated at Tesla showrooms and some cars and charger stations have been vandalized. 

The topic has entered the political arena, with Trump administration officials talking up Tesla. Trump earlier this month selected a red Tesla sedan at the White House in a show of support. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick used a TV appearance this week to recommend the public buy shares, saying: “It’s unbelievable that this guy’s stock is this cheap. It’ll never be this cheap again.” 

Individual investors have long flocked to the shares, betting that Musk’s leadership could make Tesla worth far more than an ordinary car company. It was the kind of loyalty that inspired at least one to get the company’s logo tattooed on his arm. 

Plenty of individual investors are still piling in. Of the $8.3 billion that individual investors poured into single stocks last week, roughly $3.2 billion flowed into Tesla, according to a Wednesday report from JPMorgan analysts.  

But investors’ devotion is being tested. Some sellers say they are driven by disapproval of Musk’s government cuts, or moral opposition to his more controversial social-media posts. 

Edward Sanchez, based in San Jose, Calif., was both a Tesla car owner and shareholder until just a week ago, when he sold the stock. Now, he’s considering getting rid of the car, too.

He purchased the vehicle in 2016 and then about 150 shares in the company five or six years ago, having bought into Musk’s techno-utopian vision for electric vehicles. That resonated with Sanchez, a tech worker who likes to support environmentalist causes. 

“It was a very innovative car. There was nothing at all like it back then,” he said of his 2016 Model S. “It was cool to be associated with the brand and with such a smart person.”

As Musk became more involved in conservative politics, Sanchez’s skepticism grew. He was appalled when the CEO made a gesture at an inauguration event in January that some interpreted to be a Nazi salute. The recent display of various Tesla models in front of the White House was another cringeworthy moment, he said.

Sanchez finally liquidated all his shares in March, he said, though his financial adviser suggested he hold on and wait for the stock price to recover some of its losses. “I told him, ‘I don’t care, I want out.’”

For others, the concern is more practical. Tony Herbert first spotted a Tesla at a birthday party in 2012 in Dallas and immediately wanted one for himself. In 2018, he invested around $5,000 in the company—the first stock he ever bought—with the goal of using profits from the rising share price to purchase a Model 3.

In the years that followed, his investment ballooned. But in February, he sold it all. He felt that billionaires were being villainized by the public, and he was starting to lose faith that the stock could stay on track. Herbert said he would consider jumping back in at a lower price. First, he would like to see one change in the company: a new executive. 

“Elon’s too focused on other things,” he said.",3039

1ji8oox,2025-03-23 21:20:05,Reddit,StockMarket,TSLA,That 1.5% “Recovery” in TSLA is a Classic Bull Trap,"Let’s talk about what’s really going on with Tesla stock right now.

After weeks of declines, TSLA has shed 45% of its value — a selloff that should raise major red flags for any investor with a pulse. And yet, this week we saw a tiny 1.5% bump, and suddenly people are talking about “recovery” and “momentum shift”?

Let’s be real: this is a textbook bull trap, set up by institutional sellers who are looking to unload millions of shares at a better price before the next leg down.

Here’s how it works:

1. Price drops hard for weeks → retail panic.
2. Price bounces slightly → retail gets hopeful again, thinking they’re catching the bottom.
3. Institutions quietly distribute their remaining shares into that hope-fueled rally.
4. Price collapses again, retail bags are left holding the dip — again.

We’ve seen this before, and this looks eerily familiar.

Add to that the macroeconomic fundamentals that look worse by the day:

•	Sales are collapsing in Europe — year-over-year declines of 50% to 90%, depending on the country.

•	Even Fox News, not exactly a Tesla-hostile outlet, reports that sales in traditionally red areas like San Diego are down 35% YoY.

•	The supposed “EV revolution” is hitting a wall — and it’s not just the economy. Consumers are turning away, inventories are building, and Tesla is starting to look less like a tech growth company and more like a car manufacturer with margin problems.

So yes, this tiny 1.5% bounce is a trap, nothing more. It’s not accumulation, it’s distribution. The smart money is exiting, and retail is being lured in again just before the next drop.

If you think this was the bottom — think again.

Be careful out there.

The news agency reports that the new figures add signs that drivers are turning away from Elon Musk’s electric car brand as competition from Chinese car manufacturers increases and some protest his political views.

Tesla’s quarterly sales fell by around 62 percent in Germany, 55 percent in Sweden and Denmark, almost 50 percent in the Netherlands and 41 percent in France. The United Kingdom continues to be Tesla's biggest market in Europe and was the only country in the continent to see a sales increase in the first quarter of 2025 (+3.5 percent). Nevertheless, Tesla's share of the UK market fell by more than 4 percentage points to 10.7 percent last month, partly due to increased competition from other manufacturers in a rapidly growing market (the country recorded record electric vehicle sales in the first quarter).

1jk9zkg,2025-03-26 12:56:20,Reddit,StockMarket,TSLA,This Rally Is Likely a Bull Trap,"In the last month we have seen a correction of about 8% in the S&P 500. Some say this correction was long overdue due to high valuations and the tariffs were just an excuse, others say the impact and uncertainty of tariffs are the main reason, but no matter how you look at it the impact of Trump and tariffs is a leading cause of the selloff. These tariffs have been followed by concerns on inflation, increased unemployment, economic slowdown, dropping consumer confidence, and the promise of even harsher tariffs on April 2nd.

Then, out of seemingly nowhere, we are seeing the beginnings of a massive rally with stocks like TSLA recovering 12% in a single day. This recovery is coupled by articles saying the correction was overblown and the additional April 2nd tariffs aren't as bad as expected. Somehow, all of the fears from the last month are not as bad as believed? The problem is, nothing has actually changed since the correction to make us believe we are in a better postion.

Lets review the economic data of the last month:

* Unemployment ticked up from 4.0% to 4.1% MoM (Jan to Feb)
* Federal Reserve holds interest rates steady and move from 3 to 2 rate cuts this year
* GDP growth 2nd est. QoQ down from 3.1% to 2.3% (1st report expecation was 2.6%, 3/27 we get final numbers)
* Inflation CPI decreases from 3% to 2.8% (Surprise from 2.9% expectation)
* Consumer Confidence massive drop from 71.1 to 57.9 Jan to Mar

Now lets review the economic actions since Trump was elected:

* Trump orders 20-25% tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China in March (Reciprocal tariffs ordered by these countries)
* DOGE begins firing federal employees in mass and cuts spending across many depertments
* Trump threatens to stop funding NATO and cuttoff all funding to Ukraine, forcing Europe to step up their own spending
* Canada and Europe begin boycotting Tesla and a wide range of American products (Most notably Canada)
* Trump targets the “dirty 15” for additional tariffs on his April 2nd “liberation day”
* Large consumer staple companies (COST, WMT, etc.) begin talking about consumer slowdowns and revising forcasts down, cutting expenditures

Aside from inflation, which really needs another 1-2 months of data to see tariff effects, we are in a pretty bearish outlook for the economy. Consumer sentiment in particular is concerning because that could be used as a barometer for consumer spending, which is what COST and WMT are saying is happening. But we also need to state the facts that tariffs + federal spending cuts is bad for the economy. If we go back to economics class we know that GDP = C + G + I + Net Exports. Less consumer spending means less C, less government spending means less G, less company investment means less I, and boycotting American products means less Net Exports.

Now I want to be clear, I do not think this means we are in for a massive market crash or recession, but I do think we are in for another market drop and potentially a mild recession. So how and when do we take advantage of this second market drop? Well for me that means shorting TSLA (or QQQ) on or before April 1st.

TSLA is a solid choice for obvious reasons, lots of negative news, massive bull trap rally in motion, and an April 2nd deliveries report coinciding with the April 2nd tariff wave. My plan is to open a sizeable position in TSLQ (2x leveraged short fund) and some 3-4 month puts (maybe weeklies) on April 1st or before. If we see a drop then I will ride the wave down, if not I will close quickly and reopen the 3rd or 4th week of April. Why the 3rd or 4th week of April? We will have opex that 3rd week Friday, TSLA earnings estimated on April 22 - 29, and all major companies begin reporting earnings, which I believe will be a bearish catalyst if April 2nd doesn't pan out.

Good luck out there and remember, markets are notoriously difficult to predict. If we continue to rally through April 2nd and Q1 earnings season (Late April to early May), then I was likely wrong and will consider going bullish. However, I think its worth taking this risk for the next month and half for the potential of outsized gains

Current position: 100% cash

April 1st postion: 70% cash, 25% TSLQ, 5% TSLA 3-4 month puts

tldr; tariffs bad, economy slowing bad, unemployment increasing bad, DOGE firing and spending cuts bad, April 2nd additional tariffs bad, market likely to drop bigly one more time and mild recession, short TSLA (or QQQ) by April 1st to profit, if that fails short TSLA (or QQQ) by 3rd or 4th week of April to take advantage of Q1 earning season and Apr 22 - 29 TSLA earnings

In Jan 2023, 8-10% of all Teslas on roads were leased. Lease assumes a certain residual value of the car at end of lease which is counted as asset. As the used Tesla prices have fallen drastically in recent months due to price cuts of new cars and reduced brand value, **IMO Tesla will take a hit of $5-10K on each car that is returned at lease end**. For example the residual price for a Model Y leased in 2023 was around $35K. Nowdays a 3 yr old Model Y is selling for around $27-30k. Across all vehicle types, assuming average hit of $7k per returned vehicle and 100k leases ending in US this year(50k of 3 yr leases from 2022 and 50k of 2 year leases from 2023), it's a write off of almost $700M



I think this could become a serious drag on Tesla’s financials. Let’s break it down:

### 1. High Volume of Leased Teslas Nearing End of Term

* These leases often span 2-3 years, meaning a large batch of Model 3s, Model Ys, and potentially other models are coming off lease around the same time. Number of leased Teslas on roads went from 8% in early 2023 to around 30% in mid 2024 - source - [kbb](https://www.kbb.com/car-news/tesla-pushes-leasing-as-sales-decline/)

### 2. Sharp Decline in Used Tesla Values

* Recent data (from sites like KBB) shows that used Tesla prices have been dropping at a faster rate than the overall used car market.
* The Cybertruck (though still relatively new on the used market) is said to have the steepest price drop, but even the Model 3 and Model Y resale values are noticeably lower than they were just a year ago.

### 3. Potential Impact on Tesla’s Financials

* IMO Tesla will take a hit of $5-10K on each car that is returned at lease end. For example the residual price for a Model Y leased in 2023 was around $35K. Nowadays a 3 yr old Model Y is selling for around $27-30k. 
* Across all vehicle types, assuming average hit of $7k per returned vehicle and 100k leases ending in US this year(50k of 3 yr leases from 2022 and 50k of 2 year leases from 2023), it's a write off of almost $700M

1j81wrr,2025-03-10 16:56:05,Reddit,StockMarket,TSLA,"The legend of the 'Tesla killer' finally came true, and it's Elon Musk | Electrek","The legend of the ‘Tesla killer’ is not a myth anymore. It came true, and it’s not an electric vehicle from a legacy automaker or a new EV startup; it’s Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO.

Some China EV makers have been called Tesla killers. But they didn’t match Tesla’s performance, production volumes, or profitability. None of them came even close to negatively affecting Tesla, let alone “killing” the company.

But things are changing now. Tesla is not growing at an insane pace like it was for a decade. In fact, it’s not growing at all anymore. Tesla’s global sales declined annually for the first time in 2024, and it is starting even worse in 2025.

There are many reasons to explain this situation, but there’s one main culprit: Elon Musk.

Musk has been completely delusional about Tesla achieving self-driving capability for years, which led him to neglect the rest of Tesla’s automotive business as he thought that by the end of every year for the last 6 years, Tesla would be able to flip a switch and make all its vehicles self-driving – automatically increasing their value and making them infinitely more competitive than other vehicles.

The clearest example of neglect is the fact that Tesla launched a single new vehicle in the last 5 years: the Cybertruck, which proved to be a total flop.

Musk also canceled Tesla’s plan to build a “$25,000 electric car”, which would have greatly fueled demand and allowed Tesla to grow its delivery volumes. 

Some analysts have said Tesla is building such a car. But there has been no confirmation from Tesla.

There’s no evidence that it is now on the verge of solving self-driving. Musk promised that “all Tesla vehicles built since 2016 have the hardware capable of self-driving” to a level that would enable a robotaxi service, which in SAE self-driving terms would mean level 4-5.

Musk himself has already admitted that Tesla has been wrong about that twice: the automaker had to upgrade Tesla owners having the “2.5 Autopilot computer” to the “3.0 self-driving computer”, which Musk recently admitted will also not be able to get Tesla to self-driving capabilities. 

He said that Tesla would “painfully” replace the computers in all vehicles of owners who purchased the FSD software package. However, we noted that Tesla is likely in more trouble than that since it promised that “all Tesla vehicles built since 2016 have the hardware capable of self-driving” – not just those whose owners bought the FDS package. Considering this greatly affects the resale value of those vehicles, you can make the argument that there are millions of Tesla owners out there who are owed a retrofit or compensation for Tesla’s mistake.

This is a current liability at Tesla worth billions of dollars, and there are already examples of lawsuits about this issue. 

Then, there are plenty of mistakes that Musk has made outside of Tesla that is affecting the company’s sales. The hard turn to the right, buying Twitter, boosting misinformation and Russian propaganda on the platform, financially backing Donald Trump, joining the administration and slashing critical government program indiscriminately. 

Musk’s brand is toxic and doesn’t look to be improving significantly now that he has attached himself to identity politics, culture wars, and Trump.

Tesla (TSLA) stock extended a two-day slide on Thursday as the very public fallout between its CEO Elon Musk and President Trump escalated.

""I'm very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people,"" Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. ""All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to have to cut the EV mandate.""

""Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore. I was surprised,"" Trump added.

Tesla stock fell to session lows on Thursday afternoon as Musk reacted in real-time to Trump's comments, falling over 11% near 2:45 p.m. ET.

Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns, in apparent response to Trump's comments: ""Whatever."" He continued aiming at the president and the bill in a subsequent barrage of posts over several hours.

That prompted another response from Trump, who posted on Truth Social, the platform that he owns. Trump said he ""asked"" must to leave his government post, charging that he was ""wearing thin."" He also seemed to question the purpose of Musk's department.

""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!"" Trump wrote.

Trump's comments amounted to an extraordinary public rebuke of Musk, who went from Trump booster and Republican Party megadonor during the 2024 campaign, to the head of the Trump-created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) with a mission to cut spending.

Musk kicked off the complaints over the bill earlier this week, calling it a ""disgusting abomination"" on Tuesday. The billionaire ramped up his barbs on Wednesday, telling users on X to, ""Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.""

The Wall Street Journal also reported that the strain between the two was amplified by the White House's move to nix the nomination of Jared Isaacman for NASA administrator. Musk, a close ally of Isaacman, had advocated for him to get the job, sources told the Journal.

Bloomberg reported that Musk's ire may also be directed at the fact that the federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.

The Big Beautiful Bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, with a Congressional Budget Office estimation of its impact on the deficit adding fuel to Musk's line of argument.

The nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.

DOGE itself, once led by Musk, has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find — and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.

Musk's ties to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for his broader business interests, given SpaceX's close work with NASA and regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.

But demand weakness in the EU and recent protests at US Tesla showrooms have followed Musk's controversial foray into politics, causing some Tesla owners to become alienated by Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, DOGE, and outward support of President Trump.

Tesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin. Much of the company's value is tied to whether it can fully unlock autonomous driving for robotaxi purposes and individual owners.

Meanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo continues to plow ahead and is essentially the leader in the space, accumulating 250,000 robotaxi trips per week.",840

1kduusq,2025-05-03 16:56:06,Reddit,StockMarket,TSLA,"Tesla sees steep sales drops in April across Europe: 81% in Sweden, 75% in Netherlands, 67% in Denmark, and 59% in France","Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA), [Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) is [feeling the chill in Europe](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/france-car-registrations-down-564-april-tesla-sales-drop-5945-2025-05-01/). Its April sales plummeted across key markets like France and Denmark, as political controversy and growing competition weigh on the brand.

In France, Tesla sold just 863 vehicles last month a 59.4% year-over-year drop and its fourth straight monthly decline. Sales in Denmark were even worse, falling 67.2% to only 180 vehicles.

Year-to-date, Tesla's France sales are down nearly 44%, compared to a 7.3% dip in the overall market.

It's not just about cars anymore. Tesla's limited model lineup is facing heat from new and cheaper electric vehicles especially from Chinese brands. But it's CEO Elon Musk's politics that may be burning hotter.

His outspoken support of President Trump has sparked protests across Europe, including vandalism at Tesla showrooms and charging stations. Many consumers appear to be voting with their wallets.

Tesla's European slump adds to a rough quarter. In Q1, the company's auto revenue dropped 20%, and net income plunged 71%, both missing expectations. April's data suggests the pain may continue into Q2.

More European data is expected soon, but for now, the signs point to a rocky road ahead especially if brand perception continues to slide.

1k32xh5,2025-04-19 20:29:24,Reddit,StockMarket,TSLA,The Trump Billionaires Who Run the Economy and the Things They Say,"“THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” President Trump wrote on social media last week, offering a stock tip that appeared aimed at the investor class rather than ordinary Americans watching their plummeting 401(k)s.

Howard Lutnick, the secretary of commerce, has said his mother-in-law wouldn’t be worried if she didn’t get her monthly Social Security check. Elon Musk, who is slashing the Social Security Administration’s staff, has called it a “Ponzi scheme.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has asserted that Americans aren’t looking at the “day-to-day fluctuations” in their retirement savings.

And if automakers raise their prices because of Mr. Trump’s tariffs? “I couldn’t care less,” the president told Kristen Welker of NBC.

. . . 

Democrats say the comments show how clueless Mr. Trump and his friends are about the lives of most Americans, and that this is what happens when billionaires run the economy. Republicans counter that highlighting the quotes as unfair cherry picking, and that in the long run everyone will benefit from their policies, even if there’s pain now. Psychologists say that extreme wealth does change people and their views of those who have less.

Whoever is right, it is safe to say that almost no one thinks the comments have been politically helpful for Mr. Trump, or calming for Americans.

“You have to laugh to keep from crying,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. “What did they say about the old New York Mets? ‘Can’t anybody here play this game?’” (Mr. Ayres was referring to what the manager Casey Stengel once said about his hapless 1962 Mets, and the subsequent title of a book by Jimmy Breslin.)",659

If regulations are stripped away to attract businesses, the U.S. could see an initial boom—lower corporate taxes, fewer labor protections, and minimal financial oversight. But history warns us: excessive deregulation often plants the seeds of the next financial crisis.

**Short-term Gains, Long term Disaster ?**

**Imagine a flood of European companies** relocating to the U.S., enticed by relaxed labor laws and fewer restrictions. The stock market would likely rally, *driven by speculation and increased capital inflows.* **But what happens when unchecked financial instruments start to multiply, just like the toxic products that led to the 2008 collapse?**

**A Repeat of 2008—Or Worse ?**

Without regulatory guardrails, financial institutions might take on excessive risk, leveraging new derivatives and unstable assets. Deregulated markets have historically encouraged reckless speculation, leading to unsustainable bubbles. If one major player collapses, the domino effect could trigger an economic disaster, potentially deeper than the Great Recession.

In such a scenario, it won’t be the billionaires or corporations suffering the most—it will be the middle class. A job market crash, evaporating pensions, and inflationary aftershocks could leave workers in an even more precarious position, with fewer rights than ever before.

**Is the market sleepwalking into another crisis?**

I know predicting a market top and a potential crisis is easy, and many have done it before... but with the rise of **an unelected CEO** at the head of the **D.O.G.E.**, aiming to **dismantle the education system, deregulate labor laws**, and **remove financial and economic safeguards**, are we *underestimating* the scale of the coming storm?

And I was thinking that could be a very good opportunity on capitalize on a possible crash or at least a correction  since we are experiencing parabolic growth in the market behavior. But the world in general is not very much in line with this growth… especially the US.

So I took all my profits and some more… from the stocks portfólio ( that now has a negative deposit amount 📈👻) and open on CFD shorting positions on multiple stocks.

Sounds kinda crazy but I believe it’s a great opportunity to short, or to learn more in the investing world if it turns out I’m wrong (I’m not tho)

I plan on leaving the positions open for at least a couple months, I do not plan to get liquidated (I have a comfortable margin that will grow eventually) and in a near future have open more short positions on stocks like LVMH, TSLA, RGTI, PLTR.

Just wanted to share my decision with the community. And you can take a look at my current shorting portfólio.

2 pic - that I actually shorted and the average price

Feel free to say whatever, free will after all.

In my late 20’s I played poker professionally and was on an emotional rollercoaster.  Up or down $2000 was common and I had a lot of people to talk and complain to.  I knew about investing but didn’t take it seriously.  Made bad choices but never went into debt so it’s ok.

Now I’m in my 40’s, have a job I like a lot, but I spend a lot of time trading.  I’m at the point in my life where it’s common to be up or down 20k in a day.  Was down low 6 figures in April, and on a 300k upswing.

Seems like now that things are going well I have less people to tell.  My fiancée isn’t interested, she’s just happy the house is clean and looks nice and kids are  healthy.  My mom knows I’ve always been good with money and gives me a “oh that’s nice”.  My buddies that have known me for years are so used to me being up or down big numbers that I think I have to go on a million dollar upswing for them to say more than 1 or 2 words.  I can talk to some of my coworkers I guess but most of them either don’t invest at all or have 7 figures in their IRA and have been adding 20% for 20 years and don’t really care.

I mean, this has been a great week.  Google is finally coming along and I’m up 5 figures.  Hood is accepted in the S & P soon and I’m up 5 figures for the second time this year.  I’ve successfully shorted TSLA three times this month and I’m super happy about that considering it’s actually been going up but my timing has been perfect.  FNGU has been fantastic.

I’m very proud that I’m crushing the market.  And I feel passionate about long term index investing. But it seems like if I play cards or whatever and I’m up or down $500 that’s more interesting to people.  All the time people ask me you gotta teach me to play cards or you gotta take me to the casino.  I never sugarcoat it, casinos are bad, investing is good.  There’s no gray area.

I don’t even know what I’m trying to say.  It’s like if I win $1000 it seems more exciting to others than if I make a good trade and make $60,000 because that’s supposed to happen.  But I’m excited!!!   When I make a trade, I know I’m risking a certain amount to make a certain amount but it’s exciting to me because aside from the actual trade there’s hundreds of hours of research and planning that go into it.

Anyone feel this way?

1nvbm35,2025-10-01 17:38:46,Reddit,StocksAndTrading,TSLA,Here's what I think about BYD,"BYD is the Chinese EV and battery giant that’s been giving Tesla a run for its money. They make cars, buses, and batteries, and they even supply a lot of their own components in-house. This vertical integration helps them keep costs low and gives them an edge over a lot of competitors who rely on outside suppliers. Their “Blade battery” tech is also considered pretty solid and safer than some of the traditional lithium-ion setups (which is a HUGE plus imo).

**The positives:**

* Revenue topped $100 billion last year, so we are not talking about a small cap upstart here.
* They sell both hybrids and full EVs, which is a nice cushion when pure EV demand cools off.
* International expansion is real. They are setting up in Europe to get around tariffs and to show they are in it for the long haul.
* Still profitable, which is rare for a lot of EV names outside of Tesla (also, Motely claims they've overtaken TSLA altogether as EV market leaders).

**The risks:**

* Growth is slowing. They just cut their annual sales target for 2025 by about 16 percent. They also saw their first quarterly sales decline since 2020.
* Margins are getting squeezed. China’s EV market is insanely competitive, with everyone slashing prices. BYD has had to join the discounting game, which hurts profitability.
* Regulation and geopolitics are big question marks. Tariffs in Europe, trade tensions, ESG and labor issues in other countries.
* Valuation is tricky. A lot of the growth story is already priced in (to a certain extent ofc). If demand slows further or margins stay under pressure, the stock could easily pull back.

**Bottom line:**  
BYD (BYDDY for those of you located in the States) is one of the strongest EV manufacturers in the world, with real sales, real profits, and a growing international footprint. But the easy hypergrowth phase might be over. If you believe EV adoption will keep climbing worldwide (like I do lol) and that BYD can manage its costs and expand globally, then BYDDY is a solid long-term play. If you are looking for quick gains, be aware this could be a choppier ride than the headlines suggest.",1

First, the significant moves and impact on SPY within the 50ish decision pool highlighted below :

* In the week end leading to Monday morning, February 3, 2025, Trump unveiled steep tariffs on North American and Chinese goods, leading to a 2.0 % ish ( at some point) in SPY as markets reacted to geopolitical tensions.
* On Monday morning, March 3, 2025, Trump imposed new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, prompting a 1.8 % ish ( at some point) drop in SPY amid renewed trade war fears.
* On Wednesday afternoon, April 2, 2025, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on global imports, leading to a 6 % ish (at some point) plunge in SPY the next day in a sharp market crash.
* On Wednesday morning, April 9, 2025, Trump declared a 90 day pause on most tariffs except China, sparking a +9 % ish ( at some point) rally in SPY, the best single day gain since the 1940s.
* One day after,on Thursday morning, April 10, 2025, Trump clarified that tariffs on Chinese imports would be even higher than expected, reversing prior gains and dragging SPY down 4 % ish ( at some point).

Digging deeper, below is an analysis of Trump Announcements impacts ( only the 50 ish most relevant , summary table below) on the Stock Market since January 2025 up to mid May 2025, or an average of 2.5 meaningful announcement per week since January 20, 2025; or \~17 weeks ). Index prices (NYSE composite and SPY) and sectorial ETFs were mainly analyzed. For SPY, data output and overall reaction is a bit skewed toward magnificent seven and IT sector reaction given their weight and market cap.

Some Redditors asked about how impact is assessed. This involved lot of data scraping and adjustments to isolate the effect of the news. Typically, after an announcement, I tend to analyze the index direction 24 hours prior to identify the pre-existing trend, which could come from a general event or another Trump announcement. Then, I examine the index performance 24 hours post announcement (mostly from the last close to the closing price at the day of the announcement or to a specific trading hour). So, if Trump reverses a policy within three trading sessions for instance, the broader NYSE composite index's variance may initially seem minor (1 to 3 %) over plus or minus few trading sessions, as to cancel previous decision impact and due to its overall composition, a basket of sectors (defensive, cyclical, etc..). However, when zooming on sectors or stocks highly sensitive to specific announcements, the material impact can be isolated. And after the analysis, once I find a trend, I use the help of Grok, Chat GPT, Claude (latest updates are very strong in analyzing complex data) and Gemini to analyze the raw data and see if they intersect with my pattern analysis.

At first, I thought Fridays were the worst, because a surprise announcement over the weekend could hurt my investments when markets reopen Monday but the analysis didn’t fully confirm that. What is certain though is that a Friday announcement late in the day, or early Monday morning can seriously mess up a trading plan if you have a significant dollar exposure.

Let’s see if his next announcements fit the pattern in the upcoming weeks and beyond until he decides to retire from presidency..I will be updating this monthly and include also impact on options prices

Positive impacts:

* Defense, private prison, and energy sectors often saw gains after border, military, and energy policy announcements.
* Tech stocks benefited from deregulation, AI investments, and new councils focusing on science/technology.
* Tariff announcements had mixed but generally sector-specific positive impacts on U.S. producers.
* Cryptocurrency and memecoin promotions caused spikes in crypto-related stocks.

Negative impacts:

* Broad market dips often followed announcements around tariffs on imports and federal aid halts.
* Healthcare and education sectors were negatively affected by funding cuts and bans.
* Renewable energy and EV-related stocks dropped when Trump reversed Biden-era environmental policies.
* Consumer goods stocks occasionally dipped due to tariff threats and trade tensions.

Neutral/Minimal impact:

* Social and political announcements like pardons and symbolic declarations usually had minimal stock market impact.
* Some federal policy reversals had muted or negligible effects on broader markets.

 **Typical Market Reaction Patterns**


* Morning announcements (9:00–11:00 AM EST):
   * Often involved regulatory changes, new councils, or executive orders.
   * Markets reacted positively to innovation-related announcements (AI, crypto) and negatively to funding cuts.
* Afternoon announcements (12:00–7:00 PM EST):
   * Frequently focused on enforcement actions, tariffs, and emergency declarations.
   * Mixed market reactions: defense and energy up, consumer and manufacturing stocks down.
* Day of week trends:
   * Monday: Multiple impactful policy announcements; mixed market reactions with slight dips due to policy uncertainty.
   * Tuesday & Wednesday: High frequency of tariffs, funding cuts, and enforcement announcements; often negative or sector-specific impacts.
   * Thursday: Mostly enforcement, immigration, and defense-related announcements; moderate positive impact on defense.
   * Friday: Mixed, including sanctions, crypto promotions, and layoffs; markets generally down or flat.
   * Saturday & Sunday: Few announcements, mostly symbolic or enforcement-related with limited market impact.

Most mid week news (Wednesday and thursday) seem to be the catalysts for SPY trend pattern confirmation or reversal.

1ir0k5o,2025-02-16 20:40:17,Reddit,wallstreetbets,GOOGL,This sector you've never touched is a 10-bagger. [DD],"I want to focus a sector that receives no love: Mining.

Trading at decade-lows with little investor interest, mining stocks today are like tech stocks in 2001. I'm going to show you how they have all the elements of a 10-bagger play, and how you should take advantage of the upcoming bull run

**PART 1: Qualities of a 10-Bagger**

Without overcomplicating things, a 10-bagger stock or industry can be summarized with these elements:

1. Left For Dead Prices - Prices that don't reflect the baked in value or potential growth of the company, especially compared to historic averages, since prices are typically mean-reverting.
2. Little Investor Participation - Trades that aren't crowded out by investors, muting potential future gains.
3. Ridiculous Potential - Massive margins of safety and explosive potential upside that lead to companies consistently growing their top line.

**PART 2: A Tale of Two Sectors**

https://preview.redd.it/a5aslgqpajje1.jpg?width=1341&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5045ac70d14bd4b629332bac9984ad0c845b1829

You've been a regard for investing in mining over the past \~30 years. The index rose over \~5x, and you're flat. Any active manager in Mining stocks has either been fired or full-ported into Apple at this point.

It's even more stark when you compare to tech. Over the past 30 years, the tech sector delivered \~5,000% return, dwarfing the broader market’s \~1,874%.

Investors have crowded the trade, leading to a situation where you nearly can't avoid exposure to the richly valued tech names:

https://preview.redd.it/47riv3obbjje1.jpg?width=1389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e31b8099d02c792cbb737a2f9ee17374f99ef163

Safe to say miners aren't included in any meaningful allocation in today's indexes.

But do they have the potential to 10x from here?

**PART 3: Left for Dead Prices**

The most compelling case for a 10-bagger is being cheap. Buying Apple at 10-15 PE in the 2010's is retrospectively a no-brainer. It gives you an incredible margin of safety if you're buying growth for value prices.

Miners are cyclical companies deeply exposed to the price of the ores they mine. Whether it's copper, silver, gold, or rare metals, miners generally scale with the price of their underlying commodity.

https://preview.redd.it/670ubnytljje1.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&s=685e17313d2d2d33bed2d39c3733183eced31cba

For gold miners, this hasn't been the case. Despite gold roaring to highs around $2900 an ounce, the average gold miner is down over the past 20 years.

Many of these miners produce gold for less then $1000 an ounce and have been reinvesting their income into future production. Let's take a look under the hood at B2Gold $BTG

|B2Gold|Metrics|
|:-|:-|
|Total Assets|4,788,737K|
|Total Liabilities|1,599,657K|
|Book Value|\~3.2B|
|Market Cap|3.3B|
|TTM Operating Income|600Mln|
|5yr Avg Operating Income|672Mln|
|P/B|\~1X|
|P/OI|\~5X|

Wow. You're getting the company at book value today, and at a 20% income yield. It seems like it's deep value, so what are the growth prospects?

|B2Gold Company Expectations|Gold Ounces|
|:-|:-|
|2024|800K|
|2025|1Mln|
|2026|1.2Mln|

So what does this look like as far as their sales expectations? Let's see the price of gold:

https://preview.redd.it/00gmixjgnjje1.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2b3030a72eb4b41b4938d400eeac334db5b28fa

Compared to the company's reported all-in-sustaining-cost of producing gold at $1,200 an ounce, the company generates about \~$1700 an ounce in cash at today's prices. Who said you needed to be a tech stock to get 50%+ margins?

So, let's take a look at their 2026 projected gold ounces produced vs. some potential prices of gold. Assuming 1.2Mln ounces produced in 2026, here is their operating income:

|Cost of Production / Gold Price|$2000|$2500|$3000|$4000|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$1200\*|$960Mln|$1560Mln|$2160Mln|**$3360Mln**|
|$1400|$720Mln|$1320Mln|$1920Mln|$3120Mln|
|$1600|**$480Mln**|$1080Mln|$1680Mln|$2880Mln|

The company reports an AISC of $1200, but I've extrapolated this to 1,400 and 1,600 to account for worst case scenarios. Today's gold price is near $3000, but I've shown more bearish moves to $2000 an ounce to show worst case scenarios.

If you price in a 30% increase in costs and a 30% decline in gold price, the company is still trading at only **\~6X** their projected operating income.

So, an incredible margin of safety in the bear case scenario. What about a bull case scenario where costs remain the same but gold increases another 30% from here in 2026? The company will earn **3.3B** in operating income, which is the entire market capitalization. **You are potentially buying this company for 1 Forward P/E.**

The vast majority of junior gold miners have very similar fundamentals and future growth prospects. The entire industry is priced as if gold is falling +50% from here.

Similar miners are in the same boat. You don't have to look at gold. Let's take mega miner BHP Group $BHP for a ride. You're getting the company today for 5X 5 year average operating income as well, at 2X book value. Of course upside is more limited with a larger company, but the mineral diversification in BHP means that you benefit from price increases over many minerals.

**PART 4: Little Investor Participation**

Tell me this, when's the last time you saw someone shilling mining stocks on WSB? When's the last time a mining stock IPO'd on robinhood, or your friend showed you his mining tendies? There's basically zero investor interest left in the sector. It's tarnished by ESG, political risk, and just not being ""sexy"".

If you were an active manager following mining over the past 20 years, you lost your job. Why would anyone keep the regard that failed to beat the market for 20+ years?

https://preview.redd.it/2hl2u5drpjje1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=859518764be92fb4e04cfe5721935682f6d11d2b

The mining index has plummeted in comparison to its historic market participation. The pessimism is a clear setup for a multi-bagger contrarian play.

**PART 5: Ridiculous Potential**

I've already outlined an example miner for you to see the kinds of valuations present in the sector, but  the Junior Miner Index ($GDXJ) is filled to the brim with similar companies. When you look at a mining  industry's 20 year history on google, the chart looks like shit. But have they ever outperformed?

Mining stocks have generally been counter-cyclical: When markets fizzle out, they find their time to boom.

They surged in the Depression, mooned in the 70s inflation crisis:

https://preview.redd.it/zxc6j2nhqjje1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c32453a5afd3e8390247fd643c5191303f98714

https://preview.redd.it/c4hgv5ckqjje1.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=b43b557c4d3cf05889c6f1a13c96c4ec86e939cd

Specifically, they are counter-cyclical with Tech, and boomed during the last tech cycle wash in 2000:

https://preview.redd.it/5berkqxrqjje1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=b067f3c82ff2fd8fa3d4ff135feec946d5e9f3fa

And of course, the prices of the ores they're pulling out of the ground are expected to rise as well. Inflation is ripping the price of gold and looks to stop no time soon.

Steel and iron used for building is ramping up with urbanization and economic prosperity, whereas rare earth metals are finding their space in batteries, EVs, and semiconductors.

Copper is the backbone of electrification, and every single year the world breaks the previous year's record for humans living in urban environments. Global prosperity is the true secular bull market, and metals & mining are deeply connected to global growth in general.

Nearly all metals are also hedged to the growth of emerging markets, giving any US investors some necessary global exposure.

**PART 6: How to Play It**

Here's my takes on the best opportunities in mining:

|Opportunity|Sector|Justification|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Higher Opportunity|Individual small-cap miners ($BTG) \[Gold, Coal, Iron, Copper, ETC\]|Diving into individual names helps you avoid exposure to low quality companies in the indexes. Small caps have the best potential to scale earnings parabolically.|
||Junior Miner Index ($GDXJ)|General exposure to smallcap gold|
||Individual large-cap miners ($BHP)|While not as sensitive to price movements to the upside, large-caps are less sensitive to downside movements in the underlying commodities, and you can avoid some junk by diving into individual names|
||Metals & Mining ETFs ($PICK, $COPX)|Exposure beyond gold is great, as many of these miners across different metals have similar valuations and vary in their industry verticals.|
||Gold Miner ETF ($GDX)|General exposure to largecap gold|
|Lower Opportunity|Rare Earth Metals ($REMX)|While I think the same thesis is in tact for rare earth metal miners, their valuations trade at a substantial premium to the more ""classical"" miners of gold, silver, coal, iron, copper, nickel etc.|

My plays:

I'm long the following:

1kmaqin,2025-05-14 11:17:17,Reddit,wallstreetbets,GOOGL,Opendoor is the next Carvana,"Placing a $155k bet on Opendoor, down 98%. Good luck to me.

 Account 1:

https://preview.redd.it/r5v1mlodyo0f1.png?width=1706&format=png&auto=webp&s=d394da9e1b376526ca981408f2d1a18d39d20ba1

I know 99% of you idiots won’t read this, but for the rest:

* Stock dropped 98% but is far from bankrupt. It just refinanced its debt and has $1.1B capital, $693M cash, enough to weather the housing market for two years or more.
* Company has been downsizing and focusing on unit efficiency the past two years, following the Carvana restructuring playbook.
* Made a billion dollars flipping houses in 2021, but is struggling in a frozen housing market. When Jerome Powell fixes the housing market Opendoor will start making money again.
* Has financing and staff to scale revenue by 3x, it's just waiting on the housing market
* Opendoor has been learning important things about how real estate works, like:
   * Real estate agents exist for a reason
   * Home prices go up in the summer
* Now that Opendoor knows how real estate works, it will make more money
* Opendoor is down in April because the hedge funds shorted it to kick Opendoor out of the Russell 2000. When the ETFs tracking Russell sell their shares on June 27 and the shorts cover, Opendoor will probably go back up to $2.

Click[ here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTNLPOVK7WborYt-Us1HThg1QCwyCbnJng1acrQAtoYa1iV6vd9-qFZZbdbU_SdEIbfFL9D98155zxk/pubhtml) for Opendoor’s financials in Google sheets.

**Change in business plan**:

Opendoor is a corporate home-buyer. They used to be in the business of buying homes at above market value, sitting on them a few months, then flipping them at a profit. This was a great business model in 2021, but not so good in 2022 when home prices stopped rising. Opendoor bought 35k homes that year, and ended up selling them for a billion dollar loss.

Since then, Opendoor has pivoted strategies, and now buys homes for about 10% less than they’re worth, then sells them at a profit. It’s actually a fair deal for customers: instead of paying 5% in agent fees and having to negotiate with buyers for months, they can pay 10% and skip the home selling process.

One problem though, is customers tend to overvalue their homes, so they tend to think Opendoor is overcharging them. A normal customer interaction goes like this:

1. Customer has a $500k house, and thinks it’s worth $600k
2. Customer goes to[ Opendoor.com](https://opendoor.com) and gets a quote for $450k
3. Customer thinks, “hahahahahaha I knew these guys were crooks, they want $150k to sell my house, I’m selling with a realtor instead”
4. Realtor agrees Opendoor is a bunch of crooks, because realtor competes with Opendoor

It's been a truly terrible marketing funnel. Opendoor only converts 1% of its prospective customers at a cost of $14k per house.

The new business plan is this:

1. Customer goes to Opendoor
2. Opendoor says, would you like to talk to a local real estate agent?
3. Customer thinks, ""yes of course I don't trust you crooks""
4. Agent tries to convince the customer that Opendoor's offer isn't bad
5. If the customer sells, Opendoor wins. Otherwise, the agent sells the house, Opendoor collects a commission and still wins.

It's a much, much better business plan. Nobody wants to sell their house without talking to a real estate agent first, because they don't trust corporations. Now that Opendoor has figured that out, expect revenue to go up and marketing cost per house to go down.

**Opendoor no longer lighting as much money on fire**

Look at this chart:

https://preview.redd.it/f870nejv0p0f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ad9dc55bb34e1e364ac77fd85df1a0416af2723

Do you see where it says, profit per house, -$65k? That was the Zirp era. Home prices started going down, and the CEO decided he was going to buy even more of them at above market prices to capture the market. Thankfully, after lighting a billion dollars on fire, he and everyone else responsible got sacked.

They also laid off a ton of employees, cut marketing expenses, cut waste, etc:

https://preview.redd.it/z7p2prls0p0f1.png?width=1434&format=png&auto=webp&s=04c6f5211988fe715b00d5c4fa391fb2efdd6e67

Now you might notice they're still losing money per every house they buy. Part of that is because they spend $14k on marketing per house they buy, which they'll hopefully fix by working with real estate agents instead of advertising straight to consumers. We'll get into the other reasons.

**Opendoor learns prices go up in the Summer**

Housing has an annual cycle. Prices go up in the Summer, and down in the Winter:

https://preview.redd.it/f824gu1tyo0f1.png?width=1994&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b90a8cbd312c38e374aaf42eb8f4c4d355c5ab6

Traditionally, Opendoor has been buying most of its homes in the Summer, because more people come to them to sell, so, why not:

https://preview.redd.it/63soyzu0zo0f1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=dac7fe4b5184f2baedb195d701de3b9f66008d23

Anyways, buying in the Summer is dumb because prices go down in the Fall. Not only that, but they take longer to sell which means more holding costs. Thankfully Opendoor finally figured that out this year, and promised to cut it out and buy more houses in the Winter and Spring instead. Expect more profit.

**Housing Market to improve, probably**

Back in 2020-2022, the housing market looked like this:

https://preview.redd.it/me4gb8kpzo0f1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5091617ca516a8b4971af09502f87b767a0f849

And Opendoor ***made over a billion dollars*** in home-flipping profit, although important things like marketing, interest, and director salaries managed to eat up most of that:

https://preview.redd.it/c9nuqftuzo0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2fde5b351930e96c054192e5133932ac6feb232

Then interest rates did this:

And nobody could buy a home anymore:

Which means Opendoor is paying millions in interest to keep $2B in homes on the balance sheet that are *depreciating*:

And the homes now take months to sell. Long holding times require maintenance and interest, which now eat half of profits:

Fortunately, Trump says he's going to bully Jerome Powell into making 2-3 rate cuts this year so the US can refinance its debt, and that will hopefully maybe unfreeze the housing market. This will be huge for Opendoor. All the tailwinds we've discussed will start going in reverse: more acquisitions, home price appreciation, shorting holding times and lower interest costs. In short, more money.

**Opendoor to actually make money in Q2**

Q2’s estimates is for Ebitda profitability of $5-$20M, the first time Opendoor will make a quarterly profit in three years. 2025's housing market is even worse than previous years, so this means the business itself is becoming more profitable. Losses are still expected for Q3 and Q4, but they're expected to be smaller than previous years.

**Path to Profitability**

Opendoor lost $392M last year. Here’s how we get to adjusted net income positive:

* $80M: Opendoor laid off 300 workers in Q4, which saves $20M a quarter.
* $75M: My spreadsheet says Opendoor loses $12k per house they buy in Summer and Fall. They said they're going to stop doing this so that's $75M.
* $55M: They spend $4k per house more on interest and holding costs than they did in 2021. That's gonna be fixed because the housing market will improve and they'll stop buying homes in the Summer.
* $80M: Opendoor is starting to send customers that don't take their offers to real estate agents, which pay a referral fee. 1% referral fee \* 2% of 1.2M customers \* $330k average house price = $80M
* $130M: Housing appreciation. Opendoor has $2.2B in houses that have been depreciating at 1% a year. Should housing return to a historically normal 5% rate of appreciation, that’s $130M in profit.

That’s already $420M in savings, enough to be profitable. Revenue should also grow higher as the housing market unfreezes, and marketing spend should be more effective as they learn to partner with real estate agents.

**Debt Refinanced, cash to scale through next two years**

On May 9 Opendoor announced it had exchanged $245M in existing convertible bonds due in March for new convertible bonds due in 2030 at 7% rate, convertible at $1.57. Opendoor also issued $75M in new bonds, raising $75 in new capital. $135M in bonds is still due in 2026, but this will be easily payable with cash on hand.

Following the equity raise and bond refinance, Opendoor has $1.1 billion in capital of which 768M is cash (693M from Q1 report plus $75M equity they just raised). On the Q4 and Q1 transcripts management stated they had refinanced 90% of their credit lines through 2026.

Management has reassured us that they still have available cash and personnel to return to a much larger scale of operations. In the Q1 report they stated that only $350M of their cash is invested in homes, and they have $559M (probably $634M now) available to deploy towards home purchases. They are also only using $2B of their existing $8B credit line. From these numbers it seems they have the financing to purchase 3x more homes than they currently are. Management has guided that they are capable of purchasing many more homes, but they are choosing to purchase less while the housing market is slow and margins are low. I expect them to deploy this capital and scale in Q4, assuming mortgage rates start to fall. 

**Growing Short Interest**

This isn’t the first time the bears have shorted Opendoor, only to buy back their shorts at a loss when it turns out Opendoor isn’t dead after all:

https://preview.redd.it/xdvpvau91p0f1.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b4e06e4325bf2b7efee5e90b28c4f3d0ea0bacc

The setup today is the same as it was in Dec 2022: the housing market is weak and everyone assumes Opendoor is dead, but it actually has years ahead of it and many tailwinds coming.

Chart from last month:

https://preview.redd.it/maq7tv7c1p0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=94560ccb30622d867dc6d39550747fdf46d7461b

From Nasdaq short interest we can see a net short position of 20M was added in the month of April:

https://preview.redd.it/sn7bk9mf1p0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=398ffff8aefed808010665a8ba234eb4211436a1

The price jump on April 7 was due to a good quarterly report, where the company projected it would be Ebitda positive in Q2 for the first time in three years. Two days later it fell on the news of the debt refinancing. Presumably the terms of the debt refinancing scared some investors: 7% bonds  convertible at $1.57, is expensive, and issuing them now when the stock price is so low might seem to some as desperate. On the other hand, this eliminates $245M in bond payments for next year and raised $75M in new capital. I view it as a positive development, as it extends Opendoor's runway and frees them to scale up purchases this winter. Without this debt raise, they wouldn't be able to fully deploy their capital in Q4 and Q1, since their cash would be invested in homes due to sell in Q2, and $400M was due in March. 

**Hedge Fund Russell 2000 arbitrage?**

Look at this chart again:

https://preview.redd.it/0id2wu3j1p0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c71de966368d3226cbb52398985c028d128fce8b

Note on April 23 Opendoor briefly rose above $1, then got shorted very hard in a coordinated action. There was a negative housing report that came out a few days earlier, but no news specific to April 23 and 24. Russel climbed 3.5% during this period and other real estate stocks climbed, but Opendoor fell 30% for seemingly no reason. 

One theory is this was an arbitrage move by hedge funds to kick Opendoor out of the Russell 2000. Ranking day was April 29, so any stock below $1 on April 29 will be removed on June 27. About 20M shares are held by iShares Russel 2000 ETFs:

https://preview.redd.it/orb64bxl1p0f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf9b3acb1fb0f4b565590f03e77894d0cd2daf3e

20M net shorts were added in April, and 20M shares will be sold near the end of day on June 27 by iShares ETFs when the Russell 2000 is adjusted. Probably the shorts will cover on that day to make a nice profit. As a long-term investor, this is reason to believe Opendoor's current price is disconnected from its recent performance, since all the recent news coming out of the business has been positive. Given the stock's history in the last several years of wild swings, I wouldn't be surprised if it shot back up to the $2-$3 range after the shorts cover in June.

**Conclusion**

Opendoor is a stupid company that made over a billion dollars of home-flipping profit in 2021 when the housing market was good. Then their CEO lit a billion dollars on fire buying overpriced houses. He was fired and replaced with a responsible CFO. They've been learning important lessons: realtors exist for a reason, and house prices go up in the Summer. Now that they know these things they can make money. When Jerome Powell fixes the housing market they'll make even more money, and the stock will pull a Carvana and go up 100x.

Also, Opendoor just refinanced its debt so its very much not dead, they have over a billion dollars still, enough for at least two years, more if they fix their business as planned, or if the Fed fixes it for them.

Also, last month's price action was probably just the hedge funds shorting Opendoor to kick it out of Russell 2000 and abuse the poor etfs that will have to sell at a low price. I'm hoping the stock triples after the shorts close, probably on June 27.",2798

**TL;DR:** Quantum computing stocks are the next great meme bubble — a flaming clown car of hype, government grants, and zero actual business. Companies like $QBTS, $IONQ, $RGTI, and especially $QUBT (which literally used to sell flavored beverages) are pretending to be tech plays while burning through cash with nothing to show for it. Even if quantum computing becomes real, Google and IBM already won the arms race. Experts say useful quantum is still 20–30 years away — not 3. This is *The Big Short 2: Quantum Boogaloo*. I’m shorting these frauds before they drop another 90%. Strap in.

**Introduction:**

Quantum stocks ripped aggressively since the beginning of the year, after the announcement of Willow, Google's new quantum processor. First of all, Google didn't even come up with anything groundbreaking. Ironically, this also highlights how far ahead Google is from the competition. Even worse, some of the stocks below don't even make quantum computers at all.

Quantum computing is 20-30y+ away, if at all. Yet the stocks trade like they cured cancer yesterday. This is honestly a lot worse than Nikola and EV stocks for those who were there back then. They are totally misunderstood by retail, and some of them literaly have 90%+ downside.

**Quantum Computing Basics:**

Quantum computing isn't a better computer. It's a compeltely different paradigm that is only useful to solve very specific and esoteric problems. Like factoring big prime numbers (even that doesn't even work yet) or doing weird matrix math *only under certain condtions.*

To run these algorithms, you don't need just a couple qubits, you need error corrected logical qubits, which take *thousands* of physicals qubits. We're barely

One of the biggest issues with quantum computeers is gate fidelity. This measures how a quantum gate actually performs its intended operation compared to an ideal, noise-free version of that gate. Today, even the best systems get around 99.9% fiedlity under perfect lab conditions. This sounds high, but due to the exponential scaling of quantum algorithms, erors compoound extremely quickly and at 99.9% they are literaly useless. Quantum algos need billions of error free operations and we're nowhere closes. For comparisons, classical computers have gate fidelity of between 10^(-15) and 10^(-18). Thats eighteen 9s after 99, or 99.99999999999999999%. Its not that quantum computers are behind classical computers - *they're basically unusable*

**Industry Experts**

Why should you believe me when I say quantum computing doens't work? After all I'm just a muppet. If you don't take my word for it, listen to the leading industry experts, that spend their days working on it.

Scott Aaronson (Professor, UT Austin, top quanutm complexity theorist):  
""We're nowhere near large-scale quantum computers. The real applications are speculative and still a long way off""

Jensen Huang (CEO, NVIDIA):  
""Quantum computing is decades away. It will not replace classical computing. It's a different tool for very specific problems.""

Dr. Isaac Chuang (MIT, pionner in quantum information):  
""Quantum computers are not yet practical, and may not be for a long time. The barriers are fundamental""

Even if all these people are wrong, Google and IBM are so far ahead, that they'll be the clear winners.

**The Trade:**

The most overvalued and ridiculous names are: $QUBT, $QBTS, $IONQ, $RGTI. I'm short only the first two. They're all ridiculous, but at least IONQ and Rigetti have somewhat of a product.

$QUBT: This is literaly a scam, they've got very little to do with Quantum. These guys were literaly a beverage company. They don't build quantum computers. They sell vague ""quantum inspired"" software with 0 commerical traction. They claim to be ""hardware-agnostic"", which literaly reads ""we don't have a machine"". Imagine being a quantum computing stock with no computer. Revenue in 23 was $100k, not millions, $100k. This is not even a real business, just a vehicule made to earn a quick buck. Their software doens't even require a qaumtum processor to run, it's just classical code with buzzwords. This is my highest conviction short.

$QBTS: These guys make quantum annealers, not even a real quantum computer. They've een in business for 25 years, and only make $9m in revenue, with a market cap of $4.7bn. They were on the brink of bankruptcy, trading for $1, with no cash left. Then the Willow anouncement came and they manage to issue some stock and get some cash back. As a reminder, Willow has nothing to do with QBTS, this will end going back to 0 after the hype subsides.

Two Nvidia customers made up 39% of Nvidia’s revenue in its July quarter, the company revealed in a financial filing on Wednesday, raising concerns about the concentration of the chipmaker’s clientele.

“Customer A” made up 23% of total revenue, and “Customer B” comprised 16% of total revenue, according to the company’s second-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

That’s higher than the same quarter a year ago when Nvidia’s top two customers made up 14% and 11% of sales, according to the filing.

The company regularly publishes information on a quarterly basis about its top customers, but the disclosure this week is fueling a renewed debate about whether Nvidia’s explosive growth is being driven by a handful of large cloud providers such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Oracle.

Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said in a Wednesday statement that “large cloud service providers” made up about 50% of the company’s data center revenue. That’s important as the data center business made up 88% of Nvidia’s overall revenue in the second quarter.

“We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia wrote in the filing.

Increasingly, analysts are looking to those cloud capital expenditure spending commitments to model the future growth of Nvidia.

“We see limited room for further earnings upside revision or share price catalyst in the near-term unless we have increasing clarity over upside in 2026 \[cloud service provider\] capex expectations,” wrote HSBC analyst Frank Lee in a note on Thursday. He has a hold rating on the stock.

But Nvidia’s Customer A and Customer B are not necessarily cloud providers. It’s a bit of a mystery, and an Nvidia representative declined to share the identities of Customer A and Customer B.

In its filing, Nvidia says it has both “direct customers” and “indirect customers.” Customer A and Customer B are listed as “direct customers.”

Direct customers are not the end users of Nvidia’s chips. They’re companies that buy the chips to build into complete systems or circuit boards that they then sell to data centers, cloud providers and end-users. Some of these direct customers are original design manufacturers or original equipment manufacturers like Foxconn or Quanta. Others are distributors or system integrators like Dell.

Indirect customers, meanwhile, include cloud service providers, internet companies and enterprises, which typically buy systems from Nvidia’s direct customers. Nvidia says it can only estimate revenue to indirect customers based on purchase orders and internal sales data.

Deciphering if any of those cloud providers are Nvidia’s mystery customers is difficult, in part because the chipmaker has wiggle room in the definitions of its direct and indirect customers.

Nvidia, for example, wrote in the filing that some direct customers buy chips to build systems for their own use.

Additionally, Nvidia noted that two of its indirect customers each accounted for over 10% of its total revenue, primarily buying systems through Customers A and B.

Contributing further to the mystery of it all, Nvidia said that an “AI research and development company” contributed a “meaningful” amount of revenue through both direct and indirect customers.

Nvidia told investors on Wednesday that demand for the company’s AI systems remains high, not just among cloud providers, but among other kinds of customers, including enterprises buying systems for AI and “neoclouds,” which are companies that are taking on the biggest providers with services more tuned for AI. Nvidia also listed foreign governments, saying it would record $20 billion in revenue this year for “sovereign AI.” All of these product categories are contributing to Nvidia’s revenue growth, Kress told analysts on an earnings call.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also said that the company has a new forecast of $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure by the end of the decade. It said that it could take about 70% of the total cost of a $50 billion AI-focused data center, not just for its graphics processing units but for other chips it sells, too.

Huang told investors it was a sensible target for the next five years because of how much hyperscalers were spending and committing to spend — $600 billion this year, according to Huang. He also said new kinds of customers, such as enterprises or overseas cloud providers, were joining the build-out.

“As you know, the capex of just the top four hyperscalers has doubled in two years as the AI revolution went into full steam,” Huang said.",1631

Glad to be back after a few years. I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!

Quantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.

The key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called ""computational complexity"". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. ""But, I thought it was super fast?!"" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.

What is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.

The running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \[n\], to \[n \* logarithm (n)\] to \[n^(2)\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.

If you're still reading, you're probably asking ""what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?"" Keep reading, because this is really important.

There are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \[2\^n\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (256).

Quantum computing is only superfast for **one** problem: Shor's algorithm. Peter Shor's invention moves factoring from exponential time to polynomial time. This is a scientific miracle. It started the ""race"" to create  a quantum computer (there was no reason otherwise). IBM began doing this in the early 90s IIRC. We haven't gotten very far since. Nevertheless, the dream of shifting a wholly intractable problem into polynomial time is a scientific computing achievement like no other.

There's just one problem: it's useless. Unless your business is prime numbers or discrete logarithms, no one needs this magic trick. What good is a quantum computer? Can it do other problems?

Here is the dark secret of quantum: **quantum computers are extremely slow if they are not running Shor's**. Quantum computers have gate speeds ranging from 1kHz to 1MHz. Any modern computer runs in the GHz regime with multiple cores (only one ""core"" on a quantum computer). Quantum computers have very bad fidelity (99.99% vs 18 9's for transistors), so they will fail at running any large program. Right now they cannot even run Shor's **at all**. So, if you wanted to do something AI-related or even simple calculator problems, quantum computers will **always** be slower than transistors.

Try to multiply or add two five-digit numbers on [quantum.ibm.com](http://quantum.ibm.com) \-- don't hold your breath, it can't be done. Quantum computers have a tiny amount of space. At the end of the program, the quantum computer has to collapse the superposition and ""read out"" the answer. Unfortunately, it reads out the answer in classical bits. The biggest working QC is 153 qubits, so the biggest string you could read out would be your full name (unless you are Vivek). There is no RAM for quantum. You need to calibrate it each time to run a program. It's a disaster and always will be.

QBTS is not even a quantum computer. It's a sad ""annealer"" which doesn't even pretend to provide a quantum advantage. Their computers have been around forever and don't work. I have a lot more info on this, but it is a total mess.

QUBT is also not a quantum computing company.

RGTI is the most honest company in the space, I think because the CEO wants to avoid jail time. He will tell you he has no idea why his stock is up and there is no revenue for this.

IONQ is the most aggressive in saying they will be faster than NVDA, which I hope I have proved to you above is impossible.

The rest are fake me-toos.

*Why are the big companies interested?*

Sundar has said that ""we will figure out what to do with them when we build them"". Corporate research has existed forever. IBM made huge advances in nanotechnology and never monetized them. Bell Labs is what Google, Microsoft and IBM want to be. Quantum computing is one of the futuristic cool science projects left to do. But even people at Google have told me that they don't think there is revenue possible here. Microsoft has researched hundreds of random projects. Being first is mostly a Nobel prize opportunity.

*But the stocks will keep going up!*

So buy them!

*Isn't cryptography a business opportunity?*

No. Chris Monroe (founder of IONQ) said on a podcast that the NSA does not want a quantum computer.  He said they want to know when *other* countries will have them. We have post-quantum cryptography already. It takes two seconds and is free to install (pip install oqs). America has the best hackers and spies--we don't need these slow-ass computers for anything. BUT, even if you assume the ENTIRE NSA budget is spent on quantum computers, the sector is still insanely expensive. Remember, your dogshit little quantum stock is probably not going to be the winner in a sector of 40 companies (most of whom didn't have to SPAC because they were running out of money).

*Aren't there other algorithms*?

Yes, there is Grover's which is simply a quadratic speed up: n --> sqrt(n). That sounds fast until you realize the gate speed and RAM issues, and the big secret: Grover's is very case-specific and extremely hard to implement. Ask chatGPT if it thinks Grover's will supplant Nvidia or x86 anytime soon.

There are a lot of other fancy named algorithms: but they are all isomorphic to Grover's! They reduce to the same thing. HHH is the only other unique algorithm and it fails for similar reasons.

Anyway, I am short all of these stocks. This reminds me of the dot-com bubble. They will go back to the penny stocks they once were.",1470
1irz33k,2025-02-18 01:05:27,Reddit,wallstreetbets,GOOGL,$278k+ in LUNR. Here’s how to play,"Obviously do what you want. Not financial advice and whatever.

I posted DD a few weeks back about buying the dip on this stock. Back then it was 22 ish and I predicted it would have some potential dips before going higher. Well those dips happened and I hope you scooped up some longs or shares when it was in the 17s and 18s. If you didn’t, then guess what, you’re not too late yet because it closed last Friday in the 19s and ready to rip over the next two month back into the 20s and through the 30s.

Why?

Because it’s launch season again. Last year they landed on the moon and in the two week run up to the landing, it ripped as news coverage started on the launch, getting your every day Joe Schmo talking about it. Well you’re on WSB, so you might as well jump on it before the rest of the country finds out that we’re about to land on the moon again.

Launch window opens the 26th. That means the run up is about to start. I wouldn’t be surprised to see it open up tomorrow already in the 20s, but don’t fear: any entrance in the 20s is a good entrance.

Last year the stock crashed a few days after launch. Why? It wasn’t a pump and dump. It’s cause the lander tipped over after landing. Is it going to tip over again? Highly unlikely. They spent the last year tripling and quadrupling up on their engineering to make sure that this time it’ll nail its position as the de facto lunar landing system of any US moon missions for the next few decades.

I wouldn’t sell before launch. I wouldn’t sell after landing either. There might be some profit taking dips, but the stock is just going to keep going up as their successes materialize.

Even AFTER it lands and literally moons, you’ve got earnings happening in late march a few weeks later, where they’ll break down their successes to the press and announce their plans moving forward as space missions expand. Expect that earnings report to be massive as well and at the very least, hold your plays for the run up to that earnings before making your decision to exit right before earnings or hold for another hit.

You want a short term play? This is it.

You want a long term play? This is it.

Scared about tariffs and economic conditions like inflation and rate cuts? LUNR is its own thing. NASAs doing this no matter what happens to the economy because the new space race is here. Go google articles about China’s recent moon efforts.

I’m not saying that this is your last chance to get on. But this is your last chance at getting on before it becomes way more expensive. Get your ticket stamped and hold on for the ride for the next 8 weeks.

PTs:

25 by launch day
30 when it lands
35 a week after it lands
40 after smashing earnings
50 end of year
100 when it lands with a human inside by the end of the decade

Positions:

12,000x shares
90x calls (18c 3/21 which I’ll roll for 3/28 after the landing)

Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***

The ticker? $PATH

And it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.

**What the fuck does PATH do?**

In short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. 

**Why is PATH so beaten up?**

It came too early… *just like you*, loser. 

PATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.

The nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) 

Since then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.

**Today is a completely different story**.

PATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity…. AI, robotics, and automation. They have weathered the storm of CEO change, and have established reliable income streams.

**2025 Partnerships:**

**As of October 2025, PATH has established new partnerships with:**

**Nvidia, OpenAI, Salesforce, and Snowflake. Yeah thats right, the motherfucking work horses of the modern market, NVDA and OPENAI**

This is IN ADDITION to their existing partnerships and clients: Microsoft, Google Cloud, SAP, and Amazon. 

**Earnings trends:** *PATH has beat revenue expectations 8 times in a row… and beat EPS expectations 7 of the last 8 earnings.* 

https://preview.redd.it/d8x0jx17ovtf1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e38c9aa90ea87072a1fe66d38c756b2a98dbe32

**What’s next?**

PATH has projected both EPS and revenue growth. The best part? Projections have not been raised since the new partnerships, meaning PATH is poised to surprise to the upside for earnings in December, and the market is *just now beginning to price that in.*

**TA / Options pricing - THIS IS BIG**

Bullish all time macD reversal with a gap to fill at $19. Resistance at 15, but setup to break through it after four tests by bulls in the past year, and recently with incredible volume not seen since the gap down from the CEO leaving, indicating big money is poised to capture the upside. 

***IV is considerably low at for at the money options when compared to the IV of other AI stocks, it’s currently sitting at 60-75%. This is HUGE. Options are currently critically undervalued for a stock that is poised to break to the upside and be major AI play for the year.*** 

In comparison, other market AI darlings like RZLV iv 141% for at the money, APLD 137%, SOUN 110%, RR 190%

*For you smooth brains, this means call option prices have room to absolutely skyrocket once this breaks out.* 

Current short interest per fintel is 12%. Short interest can help drive the upside breakout as shorts look to exit near 5 year lows as Bulls once again take charge.

Since dropping to $10 a share, we can see from the volume profile that there has been significant accumulation of shares in the $10-14 range, and we are just beginning to break away from that into a volume gap that will eventually take the stock into the $20's

It's just broken over the 200D MA and backtested it, bouncing hard following a small dip from profit taking after the NVDA partnership announcement.

1jllrah,2025-03-28 04:19:27,Reddit,wallstreetbets,"NVDA, GOOGL","I believe that Coreweave is already underwater, and their IPO is an exit strategy for existing shareholders:","Coreweave is set to launch its IPO tomorrow at $40 per share. Its NVDIA backing sounds promising, but balance sheet constraints and shady collateral backing for massive loans can’t be brushed off.

Coreweave managed to skyrocket into the headlines over the past couple of years after solidifying its position as a significant AI player. This parabolic rise was, in part, thanks to a $2.3b loan collateralized by NVDIA GPUs. However, a simple google search of the collateral posted for this loan, Nvidia H100 tensor core gpu, will likely lead you to the same conclusion illustrated below.

When Coreweave secured an initial $2.3b in cash from investors, they posted NVDA chips as collateral. The rapid cash injection buoyed them onto the AI scene relatively quickly. However, that form of collateral has proven itself to be less than fundamentally sound over the past couple of years.
*Source: (https://www.reuters.com/technology/coreweave-raises-23-billion-debt-collateralized-by-nvidia-chips-2023-08-03/)*

When Coreweave posted the NVDA chips as collateral in 2023, the value was marked-to-market at ~$47,000/processor. That same processor is now worth 30% less. For context - their total loan value came in at a whopping $7.6 billion near the end of 2024. Simply put: technology is advancing quickly, and the collateral is rapidly degrading in value. Additionally, the cost to rent these GPUs is falling - why own the asset when you can rent it for 1/100th the price?

In December of 2024, Coreweave breached terms of their $7.6b loan through various ""unspecified"" actions and ""accidents"". However, their primary lender Blackstone was generous enough to waive these shortcomings and amend their loan.
*Source: (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525044231/d899798dex1015.htm)*

Wildly enough, the cause of the near technical default was found to be due to an overstatement of collateral - Coreweave was alleged to not have tangibly held as many GPUs as they reported. The ""administrative accident"" was Coreweave attempting to sure-up it's reserves as to avoid defaulting on it's obligations.

That same company, ""backed"" by NVDA, will now IPO tomorrow. At $40 per share, the implied value is $19b. As it stands today, that $7.6b loan (that they nearly defaulted on 3 months ago) is nearly 1/2 of their entire market cap.

Just keep that in mind before smashing that buy button tomorrow after the buffer period.

1mp7nya,2025-08-13 17:32:28,Reddit,wallstreetbets,GOOGL,$3M on Unity - My DD for U,"**Position**     

3000 call options for January 2026 with a 30 USD strike price; you can also see in my previous postings that I hadn’t sold when we were at almost $40 and then when it went all the way down, I added to my Unity position. 

  
**Disclaimer**

This isn’t financial advice. This is all just for your entertainment.

**TLDR of the TLDR**

Unity can do an AppLovin stock move if Unity’s new AI-Powered ad Platform Vector succeeds. So far, Vector has “far exceeded our expectations” according to the CEO Bromberg 1 week ago. My 1 year price target is $200. That would represent around half of AppLovin’s current market cap; their main competitor in the ad space. Unity powers 70% of mobile games with their engine (Unity software is on 2.5 billion devices - you read that right, read it again and maybe one more time. This also includes the China market… ), but until Vector they haven’t really capitalized on this potential moat. In the short-term gamma squeezes and even a short squeeze (9.28% shorted) are possible because various whales are buying OTM call options en masse and up to 88.26% of Unity is institutionally held and most positions have been made when the stock was over $100 (according to Fintel) which creates illiquidity as institutions likely won’t want to sell a turn-around stock in a bull market when they are still in the minus. In other words, if you bet on Unity, you are riding together with the whales. And if you think gaming has a future and ads will play a role, especially on mobile phones and VR (60% of VR games are made with Unity), and you are still here, you might as well read my intro and the TLDR. 

  
[https://images.fintel.io/us-u-so.png](https://images.fintel.io/us-u-so.png) 

  
**About me**

I went from 27k to 5M+ in less than 2 years (see my previous posts on WSB), but I also lost 180k back in the SPAC days and had to start again from scratch. This taught me that I should only invest in undervalued  companies that have some sort of actual moat. Previously I went with long-term calls into PLTR at around $8 and then into SOFI at around $7 (which btw at that time people also argued were overvalued). Unity is my third and only play. The rest I have in cash. My life hasn’t changed much (only my parents know and 2 friends), but whatever happens, I’ll be able to create an animal shelter for homeless dogs and other animals. 

**TLDR**

Unity is a turn-around, it has almost 0 interest from the retail community (try yourself and search on YouTube or X if anything received lots of interactions in the recent 1-2 years. This is good, because we are so early that no popular finfluencer is covering it), it’s actually even hated among retail because of Unity’s previous management and its runtime fee non-sense. Since their new CEO Bromberg took over 15 months ago, Unity not only reversed the runtime fee decisions, but also double beat on their earnings each time. Last week they did it again and analysts all upgraded Unity stock based on the most recent quarter. Still the stock is beaten down when you look at the 5 year chart (Unity used to trade above $200). I am not a technical trader, but I like beaten down stocks that are in the accumulation zone for years while the underlying company double beats each quarter and keeps growing. I like it even more when we are now witnessing the first great results of an AI product that hasn’t even started yet - Vector. It reminds me of when Palantir introduced their AIP bootcamps, their game changer. Ok, I tricked you. The TLDR of the TLDR and this TLDR are actually just an introduction. You might as well read the rest now. At least try to read the next sentence and see if it gets you hooked for more. 

**AppLovin, Unity’s main competitor**

AppLovin (Ticker APP - check out what their stock did in the last 12 months as inspiration) tried to buy Unity in 2022 for $58.85 per share and Unity rejected because they much rather wanted to compete with AppLovin in ads since Unity has the better moat (they provide the engine on which the games run). Based on some rumors they tried buying them a second time last year. However often AppLovin really tried to buy Unity, I am relieved that I could still invest in Unity. 

**Secret whale(s)**

In the background there’s an investor or multiple investors that have been putting $40M+ in the last few weeks on Unity OTM call options. Whoever that is, they got balls of steel as they are riding all ups and downs like a madman and keep accumulating. Yesterday alone around $10M was added to this Friday’s options chain. If Unity holds above $37.50 until Friday, we might see a gamma squeeze. Also, with up to 90% institutional ownership, where the majority is way underwater, thus likely not selling (which makes the stock illiquid) and Unity being almost 10% shorted, we might see a short squeeze. It’s not my main investment thesis, but definitely fun to watch this unfold. It’s still a big if, so don’t bet on it.

If you don’t believe me because I am just claiming to be a wizard and can’t even write wizard, make sure to invest 3 hours of your time to watch 2 podcasts of the GameMakers (one is from Apr 8, 2025 and the other one is from June 10th, 2025; you can find it on YT) and watch how they are slowly changing their opinion full of skepticism towards Unity’s new Vector platform to seeing some potential opportunity for Unity to then 5 days ago Josh Chandley, Co-Founder at WildCard (mobile) Games, posting this:

**Unity partners**

Not surprisingly as the biggest engine provider in the world Unity is partnered with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Nintendo, Meta (for the Oculus) and Sony (for the PlayStation), but also with Tencent to help developers bring more games to China. They are also partnered with lots of other companies, even multiple car manufacturers (Mercedes-Benz, Toyota etc.) to create 3D models.

**Macro cycle**

We never know what Trump is up to and if we will get the next recession this year, next year or with the next president. But what we know is that we are at all-time-highs. Typically in all-time-highs the more speculative and smaller cap stocks go up. Unity fundamentally isn’t a highly speculative stock, but it is perceived as one. So, even if you think that we will soon have a recession, Unity might as well go up in the short-term. For the intermediate term in case of a recession, millions of people losing their jobs would cause what? 4 years ago when people lost their jobs and were at home they were playing (mobile) games and many programmers also created games. This was the time when Unity stock was above $200. And now with generative AI it will be even easier to create new mobile games. Unity is still the best game engine for new developers. In short, I am not too worried about Unity even if a recession hits anytime soon.  

**Unity red flag:**

Yes, I am honest here. There’s also something critical about Unity. I am fine with stock-based-compensation. That’s normal for such companies to keep talent and attract more talent. But when I read through Glassdoor reviews, Unity employees emphasize the great work-life-balance… Sorry, but if any Unity employees read this: AppLovin has eaten your breakfast, lunch and dinner in the last few years. True, you previously had really bad management. But now with your CEO Bromberg and Vector you have a real chance to eat their dessert. That’s the best food anyway. So, in the next 9-12 months keep pushing like never before to get it! I believe in unity. You have been waiting for this long enough.   ",1335

After a decade of near-absolute dominance, its grip on the global search market is finally showing real cracks.   
Google’s global search share dropped to 89%, marking the first sustained dip below 90% since 2015.  
This isn’t just a blip. For past year it has hovered in the under 90% range, signaling a real trend as users shift their habits. What is driving this change?

**Users want answers, not ads pretending to be answers**  

**Users want real solutions to complex problems, not blue links**  

**People are done scrolling through SEO sludge and digging through link farms. Just get straight to the point dammit!**

*Clayton Christensen’s* theory of disruptive innovation is highly relevant to Google’s current situation and Google knows it. The theory highlights that disruption thrives when new entrants redefine value propositions. Google’s creation of Alphabet in 2015 exemplifies a structural solution to this dilemma. By splitting into autonomous subsidiaries (e.g., Waymo, Verily, DeepMind), Google insulated disruptive projects from the financial pressures of its core search business, allowing them to experiment with moonshot ideas without immediate ROI expectations. They tried very hard.....but the gig is up!

A couple of decades ago, when browsers were still relevant, Microsoft won the browser wars but were disrupted by Google which redefined search as the starting value proposition for the internet. Now the AI native competitors - think Perplexity, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Grok etc - are gaining traction at a very high speed.

The stock price is where it was over a year ago. Even after the recent rally, it is still trading below the 55 & 200 day averages on the daily chart. And there is a bearish RSI divergence on the weeklies. 

AI search is eating Google's lunch. Thoughts?

1jfwdvh,2025-03-20 19:52:00,Reddit,wallstreetbets,"NVDA, GOOGL",Nvidia CEO Says He Was Surprised That Publicly Held Quantum Firms Exist,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he didn’t realize there were publicly traded quantum-computing companies when he made earlier comments that caused industry stocks to crash.

“My first reaction was, I didn’t know they were public. How can a quantum company be public?” Huang said at an event Thursday focused on the still-nascent technology.

The executive had said in January that “very useful” quantum computers are probably decades away, causing shares of IonQ Inc. and other companies to tumble. Thursday’s event — part of Nvidia’s weeklong GTC conference — invited some of those very companies on stage to discuss their prospects with Huang.

The quantum-computing industry aims to use the unique properties of subatomic particles to process data much faster than traditional semiconductor-based electronics. The technical difficulties of building practical systems have meant that the field is still in an experimental stage. In addition to quantum upstarts, companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are also trying find practical uses for quantum systems.

The companies on stage at Thursday’s event included IonQ and D-Wave Quantum Inc. Huang said it was natural for this new form of computing to take many years to develop since it was so novel. The companies might be able to convince him that quantum computing is happening more quickly than he expected, he said. “But I don’t know,” he joked.

“This whole session is going to be like a therapy session for me,” he said.

The six company leaders on stage gave him a variety of answers. Some argued that quantum computers are already in use to solve difficult science problems. Others posited that the technology is even closer to helping advance traditional computing.

Executives also said it wasn’t unreasonable to spend a decade honing a technology that will have such a large impact. Loic Henriet, who runs the French company Pasqal, argued that the term “quantum computing” was misleading. Quantum processors will help act as accelerators — working alongside traditional computers — rather than replacing them, he said.

1ghyq7o,2024-11-02 16:17:45,Reddit,wallstreetbets,"NVDA, GOOGL",Why I think TSM/INTC will outpace NVDA/AMD growth in the next decade. ,"Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are spending billions of CapEx on AI. Lets just look at their last 2 quarters spending:

* **Amazon**: Increased CapEx from $60 billion in Q2 2024 to $70 billion in Q3 2024.
* **Google**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion in the same period.
* **Microsoft**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion.
* **Meta**: Increased CapEx from $29 billion to $31 billion.

However not all that CapEx is going to third party AI solutions like Nvidia/AMD. Each and every company listed above has or is developing it's own custom AI silicon.

Lets look how they are transitioning from 3rd party to In-House AI silicon:

**Amazon**: Developed AWS Inferentia and Tranium chips for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Google**: Developed Tensor Processing Unite (TPU) and Axion chip for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

**Microsoft**: Developed Azure Maia AI chip and Azure Cobalt for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Meta**: Developed Meta trading and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

All those developments reduce dependence on external GPU suppliers, allow more customized/efficient AI processing and most importantly huge cost savings.

Just to understand the level of savings (and why would they invest huge R&D budget on this):

A **regular Nvidia H100 GPU**, cost approximately **$3,320** to manufacture from TSMC. However it is being sold at **$25,000 to $30,000** each!

That's almost 800%-900% profit margins that has to be paid by the companies above, when they opt not to choose In-House Silicon.

As more of the AI CapEx goes to custom silicon (will never be 100%, but expect that percentage only to grow larger over time, driven by cost savings)  TSMC and Intel foundries will benefit directly from this trend (both have EUV capabilities, INTC will mass produce 18A EUV chips next year, with Amazon as first client)

And this will position TSMC and INTC for substantial growth, because **the rate limiting factor for AI growth will be how much silicon can TSMC or INTC manufacture** for the entire world's AI demand.

1jj9s02,2025-03-25 04:02:52,Reddit,wallstreetbets,GOOGL,Thoughts on Quantum Computing - from a Physicist,"*New post, now with screenshot.*

My background: PhD student in Physics, working on quantum information on the theory side. I do know many friends that work on the experimental side, though.

As much as I appreciate the interest in my field over the last year or so, I personally think it's best to keep expectations realistic. Especially with some DD posts I have seen posting incomplete information, and even blatantly false statements (in Physics). I want to clear those up and some personal thoughts on some quantum computing startups.

**Quantum communication doesn't allow for faster-than-light propagation of information**

I have seen a DD post that says IonQ achieved faster than light communication via networked entanglement of particles. VERY common misconception about entanglement. Affecting one particle in a pair of entangled particles does not affect the other, it will just break the entanglement. It is proven to be impossible via the [no-communication theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem).

**Breaking Cryptography, more like breaking your portfolio as you baghold for 10-20 years**

Yes, Shor's algorithm is real. No, it won't be possible to break encryption until we get a quantum computer with at least 2000 qubits. The most optimal implementations  of Shor's algorithm requires around 2n qubits to factor an n-bit number.

As an example for RSA-1024, you'll need more than 2000 LOGICAL qubits. Factoring in error correction, which requires multiple PHYSICAL qubits to represent one single logical qubit, you'll most likely need upwards of 100k physical qubits before we can actually break real-world encryption. I personally see that taking at least 20 years, but some more optimistic estimates place it at 10 years.

**IonQ**

There's many DD touting IonQ's lower error rates, longer lifetimes, and all-to-all connectivity. While all of these are true, they often forget to mention one drawback: the gate speeds.

It takes around a thousand times longer to execute an operation on trapped ion platforms compared to superconducting platforms (which Google, IBM uses). While finance/techbros that have never touched a quantum mechanics textbook will point to the fact that the lifetime of the qubit is at most on the order of 100 seconds, and think that quantum algorithms won't require more than that time anyways, so this shouldn't be an issue.

However, keep in mind that the algorithms that are most likely to see real-world use are optimization algorithms like VQE and QAOA. These algorithms need to repeat the quantum circuit many, many times as they gradually change the parameters in the circuit to find the optimal set of solutions.

Furthermore, if your circuit output is some continuous variable that's encoded into the probability of measuring one of the states, then you need to repeat the circuit upwards of thousands of time to get a good estimate of that probability.

As a conservative estimate for a simple optimization algorithm, let's say that you need 1000 repetitions of the circuit, each one taking 1000 repetitions to get the output, and each run of the circuit takes 1 second on a trapped ion computer. That takes 11 and a half days on a trapped ion computer, as compared to 17 minutes on a superconducting one. If we use a pay-by-the-minute model in the future for quantum computers, then IonQ likely has to charge less per minute, since you need more time to run an algorithm on their platform. Sure, they can charge a premium for the lower error rates, but if they charge the same amount per minute as superconducting platforms, then customers are likely to simplify the algorithm they want to run (to be more tolerant of errors) to get a solution at a thousandth of the price.

**Rigetti**

Honestly, looking at their spec sheets for their platforms, and comparing it to Google's and IBM's, I don't see them pulling ahead at any point. Their board also literally kicked out the original founder for (allegedly) being a prick in general.

**QUBT**

Literally never seen any substantial work from them.

They were down going into April, but a generational recovery happened and suddenly I was up bigly. Once school ended in June and I had free time, so I sold the leaps, and this is where the real gambling journey began.



My first trades were just random weeklies, for example on the first Monday of July I bought TSLA puts when the line went up and calls when the line went down like a monkey. Believe it or not this was only the beginning of the retardedness.



I read about Donald Jr.’s new SPAC in the daily thread so I decided to invest into CLBR / PEW calls, and was up bigly going into the merger. Then, when the merger actually happened and I got absolutely demolished. This Donald guy had successfully grifted me.



I got mad at the market so I full ported into OPEN since y’all seemed to believe in it, however this time I actually made money. I’m not sure what the fuck I was doing but I bought both calls and puts, sold the calls at the top and then sold the puts after it got rugged in the middle of the day and made back the money I lost. 



The week after that I was feeling lucky I guess and went back to buying random shit (technically I never stopped doing it, there are like 200 other trades that I didn't bother mentioning, but this time specifically was just extra retarded). I don’t even remember why I got 10k worth of AMD calls but apparently I did, and there’s this one day where I was using half my port on SPY 0DTEs for some reason.  



At this point near the end of July I realized that I was being little bit too autistic, so in order to try to be slightly less autistic I went over to check out the value investing sub to and holy shit they’re even more autistic so I gave up and came back to wsb immediately. Saw some guy say that the Google antitrust remedies were coming out soon so I proceeded to full port GOOG calls a few times which yielded the biggest juiciest gains yet and boom now I’m somehow at 50k.



I just started university this year and nearly had to bag fries every summer to pay my tuition due to the fact that I am poor af, but this gain covers my entire degree, so I am genuinely thankful to this community, because without you guys I would not have found out about options. ",1028
1msanvd,2025-08-17 00:59:40,Reddit,wallstreetbets,GOOGL,"Sam Altman says ‘yes,’ AI is in a bubble","As economists [speculate](https://fortune.com/2025/07/17/ai-bubble-vs-dot-com-stocks-apollo-economist-torsten-slok/) whether the stock market is in an AI bubble that could soon burst, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has just admitted to believing we’re in one. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?” Altman said during [a lengthy interview with *The Verge* and other reporters last night](https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/759897/sam-altman-chatgpt-openai-social-media-google-chrome-interview). “My opinion is yes.”

In the far-ranging interview, Altman compared the market’s reaction to AI to the dot-com bubble in the ’90s, when the value of internet startups soared before crashing down in 2000. “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” Altman said. “If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited.”

He added that he thinks it’s “insane” that some AI startups with “three people and an idea” are receiving funding at such high valuations. “That’s not rational behavior,” Altman said. “Someone’s gonna get burned there, I think.” Over the past year, we’ve seen several AI startups, including [Safe Superintelligence](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/12/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskevers-safe-superintelligence-reportedly-valued-at-32b/), led by OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, [and Thinking Machines](https://www.reuters.com/technology/mira-muratis-ai-startup-thinking-machines-raises-2-billion-a16z-led-round-2025-07-15/), founded by ex-OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, [raise billions of dollars](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/10/ai-artificial-intelligence-billionaires-wealth.html).

“Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money. We don’t know who, and a lot of people are going to make a phenomenal amount of money,” Altman said. “My personal belief, although I may turn out to be wrong, is that, on the whole, this would be a huge net win for the economy.”

Even if we may be in an AI bubble, it seems Altman is expecting OpenAI to survive the burst. “You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future,” Altman said. “You should expect a bunch of economists to wring their hands.”

1mapebj,2025-07-27 17:39:04,Reddit,wallstreetbets,GOOGL,"$GOOGL | Reports of Search’s Death Have Been Greatly Exaggerated, NEW ATH INCOMING","Position: $200c 8/1 @ .64 a contract. Over 32,000 in OI and 35,000 in volume on Friday. Someone is betting for a squeeze. 

THE DUE DILIGENCE:  

EDIT: EU TRADE DEAL JUST ANNOUNCED, THIS IS A MULTIBAGGER NOW.

• The market sits at record highs. Google closed Friday under 193 only seven percent below the 52 week high of 207.05.

• Chart set l up looks clean. A cup and handle that began mid February already cleared the neckline. Last week was month end options expiration (an important date when market makers square their books) so the 195 pin made sense. Price paused at 195 and then fell under it because call open interest there was huge. Dealers pinned it with about 9.5 thousand contracts at that strike. Those contracts expired and the lid comes off.

• $70 billion buyback cannon:
In April the board reloaded the repurchase program with another $70 billion. That’s ~5 % of market cap sitting in the wings to sop up any weakness. 

Quiet period freeze out: Most U.S. companies, including Google, impose an internal “blackout” on discretionary buybacks that starts 2 to 4 weeks before quarter end and lasts through at least two full trading days after the earnings release. The gap lets any fresh information settle so repurchases don’t look like insider trading. 
- Q2 numbers dropped Tuesday night, 23 July.
- Add the standard two trading day buffer (Wed + Thu).
- Friday, 26 July was the first “open” day when the $70 billion authorization could swing back to full size assuming no other material events pending and no stricter internal policy.

• Low option pricing. Weekly call implied volatility is twenty six to thirty percent. That is cheap. If price and volume lift, gamma forces dealers to chase and calls can move fast.

• Pre earnings run absorbed the beat. Shares ran about fifteen percent into the July print, so the pop was priced in. That sets up a fresh leg this week once positioning resets.

• Search is not dying. Q2 numbers show Google Search and Other revenue of 54.19 billion dollars, up 12 percent year over year. The AI doom story is broken.

• Why AI will not steal the core. Large language models still stumble on location needs like “pizza near me,” “hotels in Miami,” or live directions. They also fail when users treat the bar as an address book and type “chase bank customer service contact” or “x dot com login.” Habit wins and Google owns that habit.

• Valuation is still light.

-Google PE 20.6, PEG about 1.0

-Microsoft PE 39.7, PEG roughly 3.3

Microsoft carries nearly double the earnings multiple and more than triple the growth adjusted multiple even though both compete head-to-head in cloud and AI.

• Macro tail wind. The index is breaking higher, liquidity is strong and tech leads when that happens. Google should print a new all time high above 207 this week if it clears 195 with volume.

• Longer view. When Google’s text-to-video tool can pump out five to ten minute clips with story flow, every creator will upload straight to YouTube. That adds a whole new layer of ads on top of the current engine and is a self contained flywheel on steroids. 

• Capex fears flipped to bullish. Some investors initially balked at Google’s surge in capital spending, but that knee jerk worry faded fast, being bearish on strategic investment is, frankly, dumb. It’s like a wife who wanted to be a stay at home mom getting mad at you for working too much. Also, the spend is a one off hit, and Google has a decade long record of turning big capex into bigger returns. That one time off hit was already consumed given the initial reaction to earnings, so it can be ignored now. A slowdown in spending would be the real red flag, signalling the company had lost its confidence in the AI arms race against OpenAI, xAI, and Meta.

• Cloud flips from drag to driver:
Google Cloud just printed $2.8 billion in operating income with a 20.7 % margin, nearly double last year’s margin. It’s no longer the “break-even someday” segment. it’s a profit engine that diversifies away from ads.

Game plan
I am watching the 200 and 205 calls expiring this week. A close above 195 with volume is the trigger. Low IV plus a move toward the 52 high can send those contracts flying. ",997

Google has eliminated more than one-third of its managers overseeing small teams, an executive told employees last week, as the company continues its focus on efficiencies across the organization.

“Right now, we have 35% fewer managers, with fewer direct reports” than at this time a year ago, said Brian Welle, vice president of people analytics and performance, according to audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by CNBC. “So a lot of fast progress there.”

At the meeting, employees asked Welle and other executives about job security, “internal barriers” and Google’s culture after several recent rounds of layoffs, buyouts and reorganizations.

Welle said the idea is to reduce bureaucracy and run the company more efficiently.

“When we look across our entire leadership population, that’s managers, directors and VPs, we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time,” he said.

The 35% reduction refers to the number of managers who oversee fewer than three people, according to a person familiar with the matter. Many of those managers stayed with the company as individual contributors, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details are private.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai weighed in at the meeting, reiterating the need for the company “to be more efficient as we scale up so we don’t solve everything with headcount.”

Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023, and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year, said in October that she would push cost cuts “a little further.” Google has offered buyouts to employees since January, and the company has slowed hiring, asking employees to do more with less.

Regarding the buyouts, executives at the town hall said that a total of 10 product areas have presented “Voluntary Exit Program” offers. They’ve applied to U.S.-based employees in search, marketing, hardware and people operations teams this year. 

Fiona Cicconi, Google’s chief people officer, said at last week’s meeting that between 3% and 5% of employees on those teams have accepted the buyouts.

“This has been actually quite successful,” she said, adding “I think we can continue it.”

Pichai said the company executed the voluntary buyouts after listening to employees, who said they preferred that route to blanket layoffs.

“It’s a lot of work that’s gone into implementing the VEP program, and I’m glad we’ve done it,” Pichai said. “It gives people agency, and I’m glad to see it’s worked out well.”

‘Wanting a career break’

Cicconi said one of the main reasons employees are taking the buyouts is because they want to take time off from work.

“It’s actually quite interesting to see who’s taking a VEP, and it’s people sort of wanting a career break, sometimes to take care of family members,” she said.

CNBC previously reported that the layoffs hurt morale as the company was downsizing while at the same time issuing blowout earnings and seeing its stock price jump. Alphabet’s shares are up 10% this year after climbing 36% in 2024 and 58% the year prior.

At another point in the town hall, employees asked if Google would consider a policy similar to Meta’s “recharge,” a month-long sabbatical that employees earn after five years at the company.

“We have a lot of leaves, not least our vacation, which is there for exactly that — resting and recharging,” said Alexandra Maddison, Google’s senior director of benefits.

She said the company is not going to offer paid sabbatical.

“We’re very confident that our current offering is competitive,” Maddison said.

Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other executives jumped in to compare the two companies’ benefits.

“I don’t think they have a VEP at Meta by the way,” Cicconi said.

Pichai then asked, to some laughs from the audience, “Should we incorporate all policies of Meta while we’re at it? Or should we only pick and choose the few policies we like?”

“Maybe I should try running the company with all of Meta’s policies,” he continued. “No, probably not.”",974

**TL;DR:** Reddit is massively under monetized compared to peers (ARPU of $3.63 vs Meta's $12+), but sitting on the internet's highest quality dataset for AI training. They're already making $100M+ annually from OpenAI/Google at 90%+ margins, with new revenue streams emerging (hedge fund data via ICE, premium subreddits targeting the creator economy). Management has proven they can monetize without killing the community. Multiple ways to win (ARPU growth, data licensing expansion, creator monetization).

Thesis: Reddit is the last major platform with truly authentic, human driven conten and every dollar they make from data, ads, or subscriptions flows almost entirely to the bottom line. That combination (community moat + 90% margins + under monetized user base) means there are tons of ways for shareholders to win.

**Moat/Why Reddit Matters**

Reddit’s value is in its data. Unlike algorithmic feeds that amplify engagement optimized content, Reddit's community moderated format naturally filters for substantive discussion through upvoting and downvoting mechanisms. This creates a self curating dataset where quality content rises organically. Reddit's niche communities offer domain expertise at scale. Subreddits such as r/AskHistorians or r/PersonalFinance provide high quality, contextual knowledge that is hard to find elsewhere. While other platforms deal with increasing bot activity and AI generated content pollution, Reddit's community moderation creates natural quality controls. Compare this to Meta or Twitter, where content moderation costs eat into margins. Reddit's community does the curation work for free, then Reddit monetizes that curation.

 

That makes Reddit a data goldmine for LLMs.

This creates a flywheel of engagement that’s not only sticky for users but incredibly valuable to AI and advertisers.

* Reddit is already pulling in \~$100M/year from data licensing deals with OpenAI and Google.
* That revenue flows almost entirely to the bottom line, pushing gross margins >90%.
* Unlike ad reliant platforms, this is pure margin, recurring revenue.
* Reddit has content tagged by subreddit leading to specific and niche domain knowledge which is super valuable for AI training. 

**The CEO and Why Management Can Execute** 

Steve Huffman cofounded Reddit in 2005 but left in 2009 to pursue his own startup journey. At Hipmunk, he gained hands on experience with the monetization challenges Reddit would eventually face: negotiating ad partnerships, building affiliate revenue streams, and learning how to balance aggressive growth targets with maintaining user trust skills that weren't part of his original toolkit as a pure product founder.

When Huffman returned as CEO in 2015, Reddit was stagnant, 

traffic growth had slowed, leadership was paralyzed by fear of change, and basic revenue infrastructure was missing. But he now brought a different perspective, having personally wrestled with the complexities of turning user engagement into sustainable revenue.

His turnaround demonstrates he can execute on complex monetization without destroying community value. He overhauled the interface, built mobile functionality, and completely revamped Reddit's ad offerings. More importantly, he implemented content policies and moderator tools that preserved Reddit's authentic culture while making it advertiser friendly.

This experience matters for the opportunities ahead premium subreddits, expanded data licensing, international ARPU growth because they all require the same delicate balance Huffman learned through his entrepreneurial journey: extracting maximum revenue from unique community assets without killing what makes them valuable.

**Growth Catalysts**

**ARPU Tailwinds vs. Facebook/Google/Meta**

Reddit’s ARPU is currently well below its peers and management is actively working on closing the gap.

Current ARPU Gap:

* US ARPU: $6.21 (+31% YoY)
* Intl ARPU: $1.34 (\~5× lower than US)
* Global ARPU: $3.63 (+23% YoY)
* Google Benchmark: Google Services generated $77.3 b in Q1 2025 (including $50.7 b search), with €6.35 p/m in Europe (\~$76 per year).
* Meta Benchmark: Meta’s ARPP was $10.42 per user in Q1 2025 (\~$12.36 TTM).

If Reddit can even approach half of Meta’s or Google’s yield in key markets, ARPU can more than double from here. When Reddit doubles ARPU from $3.63 to \~$7, you're looking at revenue growth with 90%+ gross margins. Even with zero DAU growth, that's \~$3B in annual revenue. Add conservative 20% DAU growth to 130M users, and you're approaching $3.6B in revenue. Right now Reddit’s market cap is 20B with the potential to generate $500M+ in quarterly free cash flow at those levels. And here is how they are going to do it. 

To increase ARPU Reddit is rolling out:

1. New ad formats (video, search, shopping) & better targeting & analytics for advertisers
2. AI powered content recommendations (already +30% in “Good Visits”)
3. Global machine translation (30+ countries)

I’m unsure if Reddit Answers will move the needle but it shows that the team is shipping fast and not afraid to experiment. 

**Emerging Data Monetization Beyond AI Training**

Reddit is now piloting financial data products through ICE, selling real time sentiment analysis and trend identification to hedge funds. This presents another new potential revenue stream. While still early stage, the addressable market for financial sentiment data is enormous. If Reddit can demonstrate alpha generation from their community discussions, institutional demand could create substantial revenue. Reddit's threaded discussions and voting mechanisms create cleaner sentiment signals than traditional social media noise. If Reddit can prove their data moves markets, they're looking at potentially hundreds of millions in annual recurring revenue from the finance vertical alone.

The speculative angle is whether other industries (healthcare sentiment, brand monitoring, political analysis) follow suit once Reddit demonstrates the model works with financial services.

**The Trump Call**

Anger is the most contagious emotion, and Trump makes people furious, which translates directly to engagement and revenue. During Trump's 2017-2021 term, NYT stock tripled (+227%) on the back of outrage fueled subscription growth, proving that political chaos drives monetizable engagement. Reddit thrives in this environment even more than traditional media. The platform's political subreddits already drive massive traffic during controversies r/politics regularly dominates the front page during major news cycles, and angry users spend significantly more time on platform, driving ad revenue and engagement metrics. As Trump continues generating daily headlines and controversies, Reddit becomes the primary destination for realtime discussion and debate. Unlike passive news consumption, Reddit's format encourages users to engage, argue, and scroll for hours through comment threads. This sustained engagement during Trump's presidency should provide a meaningful tailwind for both user growth and time spent on the platform, directly benefiting Reddit's advertising revenue and data value.

**Premium Subreddits**

Right now, NSFW content creators are farming engagement on Reddit for free, then redirecting traffic off platform to make money elsewhere. Reddit sees none of that profit. Reddit has explicitly discussed that they are working on premium subreddits. This keeps users on platform, and skims off that monetization by allowing creators to monetize directly on platform, with Reddit taking a platform fee.

Think OnlyFans creators paying Reddit a cut instead of just leeching traffic. This represents 100% incremental revenue with virtually zero marginal cost to Reddit as they're already hosting the content and communities.

OnlyFans generated $6.6 billion in gross payments volume in 2023, translating to $1.3 billion in revenue at a 20% take rate and $657 million in pretax profit. If Reddit's premium subreddit model can capture even a small fraction of this creator economy by leveraging their existing massive NSFW user base and superior community features it could substantially add to their revenue mix.

**Near Term Catalysts**

Reddit faces several key institutional milestones that could drive significant passive capital inflows. Russell 1000/3000 inclusion is scheduled for June 27, 2025, after market close, which should trigger automatic buying from index tracking funds starting that Friday. More significantly, if Reddit maintains its current profitability trajectory and scale, S&P 500 eligibility could arrive by mid 2026. The company's Annual Investor Day on June 9, 2025. I’m unsure if anything will serve as a catalyst for anything I’ve mentioned here but I’m excited to hear what their team is working on. 

**The Google Risk and Why It Doesn’t Matter**

Reddit’s top line still depends heavily on Google’s search algorithm, so whenever Google tweaks its ranking, Reddit’s traffic and revenue can swing. After Reddit reported Q4 2024 results in late February, the stock sold off sharply when search rankings dipped. The same thing happened in May, despite a strong Q1 2025 beat (year over year revenue up 47%). On the Q1 call, Steve Huffman cautioned that “growth will be bumpy,” noting that April daily active user growth slowed to 17%. Then the stock gave up its gains.

In reality, those monthly fluctuations don’t change the bigger picture: Reddit is still adding users and monetizing them at a fast clip. Short term search volatility simply means revenue and growth will be bumpy, but the overall trend remains squarely upward. The market is overplaying Reddit’s “Google dependency”. Even with occasional dips, Reddit’s growth trajectory is intact. Ignore the volatility and focus on the overall trajectory. ",914
1khfq2w,2025-05-08 04:45:05,Reddit,wallstreetbets,GOOGL,"As Mark Twain Once Said, “The reports of my [GOOGLE’S] death are greatly exaggerated","Today we saw an interesting report tank GOOGLE shares by 7.5%+ (at the low, close to 10%). My personal opinion is that google searches on Safari decreased because people default away from Safari. It’s a SAFARI problem, not a google search problem. Anyhow, of course, however, the pundits on CNBC and elsewhere are quick to come on and talk about Google’s impending end. And then, of course, like clockwork, a lot of people get on Reddit and give us their anecdotal experiences how search quality via Google has drastically fallen in their minds, and now they only use ChatGPT etc etc etc.

A couple of important points:

- In case you didn’t already know, Google gets 5 TRILLION search queries a year. That’s right, TRILLION. ChatGPT gets a fraction of that number. 
-75% of Google searches are NOT monetized by Google. In other words, Google monetizes much less searches than it can. That means there is ALWAYS an easy way to increase revenue annually for them.

- Your anecdotal experiences (“I don’t use Google anymore blah blah” is just that. I have heard for YEARS from people how “Oh Netflix has terrible shows. I canceled my subscription; Amazon delivery speed is terrible, I canceled my Prime, etc. etc.” And People invest on their own personal experience. Guess what? Google’s financials are PUBLIC. Even though ChatGPT has been out since Nov 2022, Google search queries have INCREASED. YOU may now ONLY use ChatGPT but clearly, everyone else isn’t.

- The Paradox of Optionality: There are so many AI models coming out—GROK, META, Perplexity, Claude, ChatGPT—that for the average lay person, optionality actually makes them paralyzed and likely to rely on what they know best: GOOGLE. 

- Google is the landing page. People go to google then go to ChatGPT’s site. people go to google first and type in Claude or Grok AI etc. Google is still the verb. Sure, ChatGPT has a place in the lexicon now, but when it comes to looking stuff up, GOOGLE is still the verb.

1o2zf8d,2025-10-10 14:23:35,Reddit,wallstreetbets,GOOGL,"[DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty","**TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations. It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **""Antifun""** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).

As a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a ""moderate"" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.

Despite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.

Something felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.



# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case

* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high). A cooldown was expected. This might explain a* ***normal*** *correction, but not a 30% crash on high volume. Even the 0 revenue quantum stocks hasn't corrected this much in this rate cutting cycle environment.*
* **Decrease in DAU** on sites like Semrush:
   * *Google eliminated the num=100 parameter which broke search result tracking sites and resulted in web traffic drops across all sites.* [Citizens](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2025-10-3-reddit-rebounds-analysts-dismiss-ai-fears-as-data-licensing-and-ad-growth-drive-optimism) *even pointed this out in their report, but still no sustainable bounce.*
* **ChatGPT reduction in citations**:
   * [Sam Altman directly/indirectly owns 8.7% of RDDT](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/sam-altmans-reddit-stake-now-worth-over-1-billion-after-earnings-pop.html)*, so a complete reversal of his opinion on reddit seemed unlikely to me, unlike what several headlines and analysts suggested.*
   * *ChatGPT citations alone don't bring that much traffic to reddit and only account for 5% of RDDT's revenue, so another 15% drop seemed too much especially in the context of a* [new deal being negotiated with Google](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/reddit-stock-ai-deal-google-openai/)*. OpenAI doesn't want Google to have a monopoly relationship over reddit like it does with* [Apple](https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-price-google-search-trial-774f4774?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAi2Aepz4YfkUzHlyW43XKFw5jYgLonf0RqC-XMCO1XblHovzKcMOxODMv7rkOY%3D&gaa_ts=68e8ec3f&gaa_sig=aoxKHEAywLIAKYAhJQLXOxevRchLEJ2gA5pO3e7p5VMHy7uJWtgMMSjRJ6U0IHEz5ppiUJPdvwSLlSbFSJdOUQ%3D%3D)*.*
   * *We all learned in high school not to cite Wikipedia, but we still use it because it's useful. Imagine our teachers' faces when reddit comments were being cited by ChatGPT as primary sources. Just because reddit isn't cited, doesn't mean it's not being used at all.*

This entire selloff just seemed too much for RDDT to drop after such stellar earnings and even stronger guidance in this environment where the [MEME ETF ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-resurgence-prompts-return-184355645.html)returned from the grave and ARKK is up 61% YTD. It just didn't make sense.

This was when my smoothe brain formed its first wrinkle. I then remembered there was a non-sense hearing scheduled for 10:00am on Oct. 8 which I ignored the first time around. It sounded like it'd be a meme hearing when I imagined u/spez, Gaben, Discord, and Twitch testifying in front of Congress. I also figured out it wasn't going to happen due to the government shutdown as this was the most non-essential government hearing that I've ever heard of.

Despite all this, RDDT continued to dump 5% and on Oct. 8 right at 10:00am on the day of the originally scheduled hearing when it was clear the hearing was postponed, RDDT bounced. I thought to myself, did we actually bounce because the hearing was canceled. **Then it clicked. My second wrinkle** popped into existence. I downed my Red Bulls and put together this timeline.

# 🤯From Smoothe Brain to Wrinkley Brain

After putting together this timeline and matching it up against the way RDDT has been moving over the past 3 weeks, everything made so much more sense. There were enough examples of global radicalism linked to social media, to the point it spooked bulls.

The smart money took profits and the **🌈** Bears shorted RDDT bigly, betting that u/spez would be crucified at the hearing. At the hearing, **Spez would be in a lose/lose situation** where his only option would be to confirm that reddit does not allow doxxing, bans users who threaten violence, etc. and **agree to do whatever the Congressional circus** demands him to do, otherwise, **they would threaten to remove reddit's** [**Section 230 immunity**](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46751) which would **result in reddit being liable** as a publisher for what redditors post. **A death sentence ☠️ for reddit and all social media companies**.

This would of course be perceived by redditors as a capitulating on free speech, and I'm sure many redditors would threaten to leave. Spez also can't pull a Zuck and donate to Trump as this would piss off most redditors even more.

The concession I speculate Spez made was by proactively sunsetting of public chats. While I find this feature is helpful at times for subreddits like r/redditstock, I don't use it much personally but I know other redditors love it. What I can see happening is bad actors using it for nefarious purposes. It wouldn't surprise me if there may have been a few ""Antifun"" individuals who abused this community function which resulted in getting this feature disabled for everyone.

In the context of these outbreaks of violence with social media being used by bad actors, I speculate that Sam Altman, an 8.7% shareholder of RDDT and former reddit CEO of 4 days, may have expedited an update to reduce reddit citations given that only a month prior, reddit was frequently cited making up 41% of LLM citations. Or this was pure coincidence but the timing just seemed a bit sus. Either way, Altman wouldn't want to risk being on Trump's shitlist and risk Trump accusing ChatGPT of being woke due to a high citation percentage of reddit. That would risk development of Star Gate.

What I completely disagree with is commentary from some analysts who argued that reddit data and OpenAI's relationship with reddit is any less valuable after this change. Reddit is incredibly valuable for sentiment analysis and for verifying if a product with thousands of 5 star reviews is actually legitimate. Like random ass Chinese bluetooth headphones from Xyrbx with a 4.95 rating and over 3,000 reviews. Reddit sentiment analysis would easily flag that as being fake af.



# 🔬Testing My Theory

If my interpretation of the timeline holds true, I thought that one way to test this is to see how META moved during this time, even though they weren't invited for the hearing. And look, META and RDDT's movement look quite similar. The major risk to all social media companies is if Trump were to threaten the removal of Section 230 immunity . But with the ""Antifun"" terrorist designation, well, that causes an even bigger problem for all social media companies.

AMZN (Twitch/Hassan Piker) and NFLX (streaming service of Money Heist which popularized the song Bella Ciao which was declared to be the anthem of ""Antifun"") also moved similarly to RDDT and META since September. All 4 stocks started to recover yesterday as I believe ""Antifun"" short covering started.

And if there was a lot of fear with civil uprisings, I thought, why not look into opening up a trade in guns and gold if you have govenment topplings happen. Gun stocks are up 30% from September, and GLD is at the moon. So yes, there was a clear systematic trade that bet on all this and those trades are reversing.



# 💎💰🚀The Trade Thesis

The **🌈** Bears positioned for an Oct 8 hearing without realizing that the hearing was postponed due to the government shutdown. After seeing that the ""Antifun"" roundtable didn't trigger a full on collapse below yesterday's support, this signaled that the ""Antifun"" trade bottomed out and the covering started. Options flow yesterday showed a lot of puts being sold and the return of 🐂🐳Bull whales with **$7.5M** in **210 and 220 strike June 2027 calls** which sparked a lot more call buying and confirmation of the bull flag breakout.

There are still a lot more **🌈** Bears who haven't made this ""Antifun"" short connection and still think all of this is related to RDDT being a meme, is no longer useful to AI, and will miss on earnings. They're about to get blown out as **Polymarket puts the shutdown ending after 10/15 at 85% odds**. RDDT earnings is on Oct 30, so there is only a limited window for the hearing to be scheduled before earnings. I actually see **RDDT as a hedge for a prolonged shutdown** as this just delays the upcoming hearing.

With \~16-18% short interest, RDDT's tiny float, and an earnings blackout period coming up, the time is now to give the **🌈** Bears a new gap. With an expected earnings blow out and the hearing having already been priced in, I think we'll break to new ATHs post earnings. I do expect a moderate pullback once the hearing is officially rescheduled but view the hearing as a buy the news event.

After a new ATH and 2 back-to-back rate cuts, this would make RDDT a top contender for S&P 500 inclusion in the December S&P 500 balancing. RDDT was skipped in September despite the 4 consecutive quarters of profit. Just look at how APP and HOOD ripped after the inclusion. Except this would be during the Santa Claus rally and complete index rebalancing in the last trading day of December. 🚀🚀🚀

Over the last few weeks… bruh... Google has been **DRAGON DANCING**. Sacrificing short-term gains to buff its *long-term attack and movement speed stats*.

Like my analysis on hims, Charizard earlier was doing premature flamethrowers, unable to impress the other step-dragons because of it's lack of fore, I mean preparation. That’s right. Not consolidating. Not pulling back. **CHARGING. ITS. STATS.**  
  
This is shown by the wiggles downward from the 1W candles. But this isn’t weakness — it’s a *setup*. Because of this, Google stock will do 1.5X the gains and 1.5X movement after casting DRAGON DANCE TWICE for a total of 3x gains, 3x speed in total.

Now here’s where it gets 🔥**SERIOUS**🔥:

At $157, the chart shows **resistance forming a textbook Metapod Cluster Formation** — known for attempting to **Harden** and slow bullish momentum.

BUT…

**CHARIZARD HAS FULLY FORMED ON THE CHART.** **FULLY FKING ERECT.**  
  
That means Google stock will use FLAMETHROWER at the $157 resistance along with the 3X speed and damage from Dragon Dance to burn that past the bearish METAPODS who try hardening at that price.

For this very reason, I bought $100k in Google 2026 Calls. Fire-breathing dragon with 3x buffs isn't just Bullish like a Taurus or Bearish like an Usurang— it’s LITERALLY A LEVEL 100 DRAGON THAT WILL 1 SHOT ANYTHING IN ITS WAY, so DRAGONISH.   
  
**🌀 TLDR: Dragon Dance has been used TWICE. Google will use Flamethrower at $157.  CHARZARD FULLY ERECT ON CHART, EYES GLOWING TAIL BLAIZING. Google $200 imminent.**

My background: I'm a graduate student and researcher in quantum complexity theory. I'm not a hardware engineer, but I do follow developments in quantum hardware closely. Based on my analysis, I have serious concerns that QUBT’s claims may amount to fraud.

[Positions](https://i.imgur.com/cxvZaJa.jpeg). I fully believe that the stock of this [beverage-company-turned-quantum-computing](https://i.imgur.com/Ndz0r8p.png) should go to $0 (or close to it) and it is only a matter of time before it does.

I will split this post into a few parts. First, we will review their fundamentals. Then, we will look into their future claims. Finally, we will review any contracts and future prospects.

**1)** **Fundamentals.** The market cap of QUBT is $3.73 billion and for the three-month period ending June 30, 2025, QUBT reported revenues of $61,000 (yes, you read that right), a decrease from the $183,000 generated in the same quarter of the previous year. They do not have a P/E ratio, as they are unprofitable (you could think that their P/E ratio is high and negative). This means that they have an enterprise value of roughly $3.38 billion which comes almost entirely from their market cap and with a revenue of $263k, their EV/revenue ratio is 12.870. To put it into perspective how extreme that is: 


Company | Enterprise Value/Revenue
-------|------------------------
QUBT | 12870
IONQ | 419
GOOGL | 8
RDDT | 20

If you think RDDT is inflated, then QUBT is roughly 643 more inflated.
Equivalently, RDDT's price would be $137,602 with QUBT's ratio.
This isn't just a premium or hopeium, this is complete detachment from any financial logic or reality.

The company's operational model is a financial black hole. While generating almost no income, its operating expenses nearly doubled year-over-year to $10.2 million for the quarter, resulting in a $10.2 million operating loss. That means the company spent over $167 for every single dollar it made in revenue. The bottom line was a net loss of $36.5 million for the quarter.

QUBT's narrative is that it's a pioneer in one of the most capital-intensive R&D races in human history. Yet, its R&D investment totaled $6.0 million. To compare, [Google and IBM are forming partnerships to pour $150 million into university research alone](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/05/19/ibm-and-google-join-forces-invest-150-million-in-quantum-computing-research-at-us-and-japanese-universities/), with their internal budgets estimated to be in the billions. How can QUBT possibly compete, let alone innovate, when its R&D budget is a rounding error for its serious competitors?

**2)** **Their future plan.** [This is straight from their presentation.](https://i.imgur.com/p0L9RhX.png) For 2025, they claim ""Early revenues primarily from early adopters."" This is their present reality: microscopic revenues. For 2026-2027, they project ""High-margin revenue from first mover advantage"" and ""Strong pipeline conversion."" These are classic, undefined marketing terms. What constitutes ""high-margin""? 20%? 80%? How much revenue? A million dollars? A hundred million? The lack of any figures makes these claims meaningless. There is no way to measure their performance or hold them accountable. They have no viable plan to get an advantage.
In 2028, the goal is ""Sales Growth => Market Growth."" This is a generic corporate objective, not a financial forecast. It's a promise to perform well in an undefined future market.

They sell something they call the DIRAC-3, which is an analog quantum annealer. It is not a universal quantum computer capable of running a wide range of algorithms. Its sole function is to find approximate solutions in a a narrow category of optimization problems. In practice, its actual use is almost certainly confined to experimental and research settings. The buyers are not businesses looking to solve their core operational issues, but rather academic institutions or corporate R&D labs that are exploring novel computing architectures. For these niche customers, the DIRAC-3 serves as a piece of laboratory equipment to test theories, publish papers, and perhaps make small claims in quantum-adjacent research. The almost non-existent revenue confirms that it is not being deployed for any meaningful commercial or production-level task.

The primary reason a research group might acquire a DIRAC-3 has little to do with solving a pressing business problem better than a classical computer. Its appeal lies in its novelty and convenience. The machine's use of ""qudits"" and its analog architecture makes it a fun object of academic study at the very best. In essence, someone would want the DIRAC-3 not because it provides a superior solution, but because it is a comparatively cheap tool for exploration and playing around, not a tool for production.

The future prospects for the DIRAC-3 appear exceptionally bleak. It is trapped in a brutally competitive field and it has failed to demonstrate a decisive advantage. To be commercially viable, it must solve a specific, high-value optimization problem significantly faster or cheaper than the highly-refined classical software that has been developed over decades. There is zero evidence that it can do this, and it will never be able to do so. Its potential market is being squeezed from both sides: classical optimization algorithms continue to improve, while the slow but steady progress of true universal quantum computers (i.e. by Google and IBM) threaten to make such intermediate devices obsolete. The DIRAC-3's most probable fate is to become a technological footnote. It is an interesting but ultimately unsuccessful architectural experiment that never found a problem it could solve well enough to justify its own existence in the commercial world.

They make some claims of what they ""will develop"":

First is the Photonic Intelligent Unit (PIU), or ""Reservoir Computer,"" which is being marketed as a revolutionary device for ""compute at the edge"" and Artificial Intelligence. This is straight up misleading and the reality is that reservoir computing is a highly obscure, academic niche even amongst researchers. It has zero commercial adoption. The AI market is not asking for this and it never will, not even in 20 years. AI is built around GPUs and specialized AI chips from NVIDIA, Google, and Apple. The notion that QUBT's niche device, based on a fringe computing model, could make even the smallest dent in this market is laughable. It is a solution in search of a problem, a research gadget being passed off as a commercial AI accelerator. Its only potential customers are a handful of academics, not the enterprises driving the AI revolution. I fully believe they only included the word ""AI"" as a buzzword to attract and scam more investors into their sham of a company.

Next is the Quantum Cyber Module (QCM), which promises ""unconditional security at chip scale"" and is supposedly destined for ""cell phones."" This is pure fantasy. At its core, this device is likely just a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG), a piece of hardware that has been around for years. While useful for specific cryptographic applications, the market is small, and established competitors like ID Quantique have dominated it for over a decade. The claim of putting this technology into a cell phone is absurd. The cost, size, and marginal benefit over existing cryptographic algorithms make it a non-starter for any mass-market device. It is a commodity component being dressed up in a superhero costume of ""unconditional security"" to attract investors who are fearful of cyber threats but ignorant of the actual technology.

Finally, the company claims to have a ""Quantum Intelligent Sensing Module"" (QISM) focused on LiDAR applications, boasting ""unparalleled detection accuracy."" This is, perhaps, the most ridiculous claim of all (and they have made a lot of crazy claims!). Consider heavily-funded companies like Luminar and Velodyne fighting for razor-thin margins and massive automotive and defense contracts. These companies have invested billions in manufacturing scale, supply chains, and industry partnerships. QUBT has none of this. Their supposed technological edge (single-photon detection) is a known technique with its own significant drawbacks, not a magic bullet. They are entering a market with a lab prototype and a marketing slogan. Their sensing platform has no viable path to commercialization and stands zero chance against the alternatives.

In conclusion, these other ""gadgets"" are not serious products. Each one is a lab-level prototype, carefully branded with the buzzwords of a hot industry (AI, cybersecurity, autonomous vehicles) to create the illusion of a diversified, high-tech portfolio. In reality, none of these products have a credible path to generating meaningful revenue or competing in their respective markets.

**3) Lawsuits and future contracts.** QUBT is now facing multiple securities class-action lawsuits that accuse the company and its leadership of securities fraud. The allegation is that QUBT deliberately misled investors through a series of false statements and material omissions designed to artificially inflate its stock price.

A central point in the lawsuits is the systematic misrepresentation of its relationship with NASA. The company presented itself as a key strategic partner, implying its technology was integral to the space agency's operations. The lawsuits allege this was a calculated falsehood. In reality, the company had only received a few minor Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants. These are common, low-value awards and do not represent a major strategic partnership. The plaintiffs argue that QCi improperly used the NASA brand to create a false impression of credibility and technological validation. In fact, you would be surprised how easy a company can get one of these contracts. The NASA Phase I grants QCi received were for approximately $125,000 to $150,000 each. It's the financial equivalent of a student receiving a $1,000 university grant to work on a science fair project, and then telling investors they have a major strategic partnership with the university to revolutionize the field.

The legal complaints further allege that the company created a false narrative of commercial readiness. While executives claimed to have market-ready products like the DIRAC-3 and a significant sales pipeline, the company's public financial filings reported negligible revenue. This data is presented as direct evidence that the commercial operations described to investors were a fiction. The lawsuits contend that the company was not a viable business but was merely pretending to be one to support its inflated market valuation.

Finally, the lawsuits claim that QCi made unsupported statements about its technological superiority, including achieving ""quantum advantage,"" without providing the necessary scientific proof. The plaintiffs argue that these were not good-faith claims but were technical jargon used to intentionally mislead investors who could not independently verify their accuracy. These legal actions now pose a direct threat to the company's operational stability, demanding millions in legal fees, consuming management's focus, and causing irreversible damage to its reputation.

**4) My personal note.** The field of quantum computing and its adjacent disciplines is still in its embryonic stage. It is a very active research field with a lot of math to discover, but hardware progress is extremely slow and there are no signs that it will speed up any time soon. 
Any prospect of a profitable, commercial quantum computing business remains decades away. A conservative estimate would place the timeline for consistent profitability at 20 years or more, and even then, it will only be achieved by the organization that makes fundamental breakthroughs in research. That level of discovery will not come from an underfunded startup with a negligible R&D budget; it will almost certainly emerge from major research universities and/or Google and IBM. They possess scientific talent required to solve the hardest problems in science, QUBT does not.

Given this context, the valuations attached to companies like Quantum Computing Inc. are fundamentally absurd. They are not based in any recognizable financial or scientific reality. The claims made by the company's leadership are not merely optimistic; they are so far removed from the current state of the art that no credible expert in the field would support them. This disconnect is so severe that it transcends poor business strategy and enters the realm of potential securities fraud. When a company's public statements and valuation are in such stark opposition to the consensus of the scientific community, it raises serious questions that demand investigation by the appropriate financial authorities to determine if investors were willfully deceived.",714

I'm here to tell you that $GOOGL / $GOOG is the most criminally undervalued stock in mega-cap tech because it’s the undisputed leader in the technologies that define the next century. Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.

**1. Future of Tech**

**Waymo**

Google's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities

In San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. 

The sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.

  
**Quantum Leap for Humanity**

The recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.

Specifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.

What Quantum Echoes Will Do

This breakthrough directly accelerates the original promise of quantum computing:

* Design Better Drugs and Cures: The Quantum Echoes algorithm ran 13,000 times faster on Willow than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This technique—which is already being used in a quantum-enhanced version of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to study molecular structure—will dramatically cut the time it takes to discover and develop new, more effective medicines by providing unprecedented insights into how potential drug compounds interact with disease targets.
* Create Advanced New Materials: The algorithm's power to reveal previously undetectable details about atomic interactions will unlock the discovery and design of novel materials. This is vital for creating the next generation of:
   * High-Performance Batteries (for electric vehicles and energy storage).
   * More Efficient Solar Cells.
   * Lighter, Stronger Polymers for manufacturing and aerospace.

In short, Google's Quantum Echoes is an engineering milestone that moves quantum computing from a theoretical concept to a practical, verifiable machine for solving humanity's hardest scientific problems.

Think of it this way - The average age of a few generations from now will be approximately 100 years. This is truly remarkable.

  
**AI: The Medical Revolution**

AI, particularly from Google DeepMind, is already achieving breakthroughs that save time, money, and lives. This is AI's immediate, profitable impact.

* AlphaFold & Isomorphic Labs: AlphaFold, an AI model from DeepMind, solved the 50-year-old problem of protein folding. This monumental achievement earned Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis and John Jumper a share of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (along with David Baker). In simple terms, proteins are the body's tiny machines. Knowing their 3D shape is the blueprint for creating drugs. AlphaFold can find that blueprint in minutes, a process that used to take years. Isomorphic Labs is now using this and other advanced AI to design new small-molecule drugs from scratch at ""digital speed,"" accelerating drug discovery from years to months.
* AI and Quantum Synergy: This is where the magic happens. AI (the brain) helps guide the ultra-powerful quantum computer (the brawn) by identifying which molecules to focus on and then analyzing the quantum simulation results. This hybrid approach makes breakthroughs possible that would be computationally impossible otherwise. Google is the only company with a dominant lead in *both* technologies.

  
**2. AI Supremacy: The Foundational Architect**

The current AI boom exists because of Google, and its competitive position is strong due to decades of strategic investment focused on making powerful technology affordable enough to scale effectively. By now, it is widely known that the foundational technology for modern AI—the Transformer architecture—was created by Google.

* Models: Leading Across the Modalities Google has established market-leading or top-tier models across text, image, and video.
   * Text & Multimodal: The Gemini family of models sets the pace in multimodal reasoning, handling text, code, audio, and video inputs.
   * Image (Nano Banana/Imagen): The technology powering Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) excels at enterprise-critical tasks like advanced editing that preserves character/product consistency across iterations—a crucial capability for marketing and design.
   * Video (Veo): Google's cutting-edge video generation models, like Veo, are rapidly advancing the state-of-the-art in creating high-quality, long-form video content.
* Infrastructure: The TPU Efficiency Moat Google designs its own custom AI chips, the Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are engineered for peak AI efficiency and low-cost operation. They have spent years perfecting this hardware because a tech needs to be affordable for it to scale and work. This commitment to efficiency is so superior that competitors, including major AI labs, must increasingly rely on the latest generations of Google's custom hardware by coming to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to train and run their own cutting-edge models. This external validation proves that Google's approach is about making large-scale AI economically sensible.

The Vertical Advantage:

Google is the only major company that is competing fiercely and winning or coming close to the top in every critical layer of the AI stack:

1. Infrastructure (TPUs): Competing directly with NVIDIA on highly efficient, specialized AI silicon.
2. Foundation Models (Gemini, Imagen, Veo): Competing with OpenAI/Microsoft and Anthropic on core intelligence.
3. Applications (Nano Banana, AI Overviews): Integrating AI features into products that serve billions of users globally.

This end-to-end control, from the silicon chip to the final consumer application, provides a powerful strategic and economic advantage that is unmatched in the industry.

  
**3. The ChatGPT Myth and Search Dominance**

The idea that chatgpt will kill Google Search is a false narrative. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit all were supposed to reduce google search queries. They have only grown. This new technology has made it much easier to ask any type or questions in any language. We were previously limited to what we would or could google. Now there are no limits. The more we know, the more questions we have and the more we search. Google search will be just fine.

I think ChatGPT will become another app on the phone where users will go to. I envision it as a personal assistant and less of search. But only time will tell.

Google was and will remain the gateway to the internet. The new AI business will be a net positive for Google by creating a new revenue stream through Google Cloud (GCP) and gemini features and subscriptions to its user base.

**4. The Financial Powerhouse and PE Hypothesis**

The fundamentals confirm this giant is firing on all cylinders.

* Net Income King: Alphabet's Trailing Twelve Months net income ending June 30, 2025, was $115.573 Billion, making it one of the most profitable companies in the world. This was more than MSFT $101.832 billion and APPL $99.280 billion
* Accelerating Triple-Threat Growth: All core segments - Google Cloud, Youtube and Google Search  are growing at double-digit rates.

The core reason Google's Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is generally lower than many other tech companies is its revenue mix being heavily dominated by consumer advertising.

  
Simply put, investors are willing to pay a higher multiple (PE) for the more predictable, higher-margin, and rapidly growing recurring revenue streams typical of enterprise software and cloud platforms.

My hypothesis is with AI increasingly driving revenue through Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the enterprise segment will become a bigger component of Google's business mix, and hence, the company will earn a higher blended Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio. This is because Enterprise and Cloud businesses are valued more highly, providing predictable, high-margin, recurring subscription revenue (SaaS), a financial profile superior to advertising. As this higher-multiple segment captures a greater share of Google's overall profit, the market will be forced to re-rate $GOOGL with a higher blended multiple, making the current valuation—which is depressed by the ad-centric multiple look like a significant undervaluation and a compelling investment opportunity.

  
TLDR : GOOGL is a generational buy. You're buying the best-in-class *present* (Search/Maps/YouTube), the scaled *near-future* (Waymo/GCP), and the *long-term future* (Quantum/AI Core Tech) at a discount.

1j09c5p,2025-02-28 15:47:56,Reddit,stocks,GOOGL,Skype to Shut 14 Years After Microsoft’s $8.5 Billion Purchase,">Microsoft Corp. is signaling the end of the line for Skype, the iconic internet calling and chat service it bought almost 14 years ago.

>Once a byword for digital calls that bypassed long-distance charges, Skype was surpassed in recent years by smartphone-native communication apps and Zoom video calls. When Microsoft tried to stretch the Skype brand into the workplace, it lost out to Slack Technologies Inc.

>Microsoft’s response was to start from scratch and build Teams, a chat, voice and video communication service for the workplace, which gained ground as part of its software bundle. The Redmond, Washington-based company will offer Skype users the option of migrating to Teams, which is now its strongest rival to Salesforce Inc.-owned Slack, before it shuts down in May.

>“I’ve been at Microsoft for over 30 years, and there’s a lot of software that we’ve done that was incredibly valuable in its era, and then the next era came and it was the foundation,” said Jeff Teper, a Microsoft president who oversees communications and collaboration tools.

>Microsoft said there were more than 300 million monthly Skype users in 2016, but its daily user count had dwindled to 36 million in 2023. Teams, by comparison, has risen to 320 million monthly users.

>Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs, Skype at one time was owned by eBay Inc. and was in the hands of a private equity-led consortium when Steve Ballmer came knocking. The then-Microsoft boss made an uncharacteristically splashy bet on the market leader in online calls, paying $8.5 billion, a 40% premium to Skype’s internal valuation. The May 2011 deal was the largest acquisition by Microsoft at the time, and Skype became a key piece of its strategy for the emerging mobile age.

>It didn’t pan out as Ballmer would have hoped. Upstarts like Telegram, Snapchat, WeChat and WhatsApp solved problems that Skype didn’t. Microsoft’s center of gravity in corporate software ultimately ensnared Skype, which found itself in the Office division and under orders to build tools geared toward a workplace audience as well as a consumer one.

>By the time Slack arrived on the scene, Skype users were complaining that elements of the core experience had started to break down. They cited missed or phantom calls and failures to sync information on different devices. The company worked to improve the service’s reliability, but some loyal users were put off by frequent redesigns, including a short-lived effort to fashion Skype in the mold of Snapchat.

>Microsoft, which also saw its acquisition of Nokia Oyj’s mobile phone business end in failure, is far from alone in encountering rejection by a fickle consumer market. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has cycled through several iterations and brands for its online communications tools, which are today known as Chat and Meet. And this month, Amazon.com Inc. said it would be winding down Chime, the video and voice calling service it tried with little success to sell to corporate clients.

>The Windows maker is shuttering Skype to focus on developing new features for Teams, including artificial intelligence tools, Teper said. The company is working to infuse AI into its product suite, while keeping a lid on spending that isn’t part of that effort. It’s reassigning staff that had worked on Skype to other areas of the business and will not lay anyone off, Teper added.

>At one point, Skype played host to one of Microsoft’s biggest AI demonstrations: a real-time translator. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella had nudged researchers to bring the product to market as quickly as possible and heralded it as “magical” in a 2014 demonstration early on in his tenure.

>Teams is “going well and this is a step to double down on it,” Teper said, adding that Microsoft wanted to keep Skype running until it was confident that the Teams version for individual users was fully ready. “It’s the most successful product in its category by far,” he said.

**My Take:** Thank god. ZM might stand to be a major benefactor from this. MSFT already has Teams that serves as a workplace call tool, but Skype has tried to expand into the workplace forum space (like Slack) and has failed. MSFT is citing this more as a doubling-down on Teams rather than admitting ZM has eaten their lunch here.",2651
1jalltg,2025-03-13 21:17:22,Reddit,stocks,GOOGL,Stocks Tumble Into Correction as Investors Sour on Trump,"he world’s most widely followed stock-market benchmark slid into a correction on Thursday, a drop that underscores how the two-year-long bull market is running out of steam in the early days of the Trump administration.

The move stems from investors’ growing pessimism about the whipsawing policy pronouncements from Washington over the past few weeks. On-again, off-again tariffs and mass layoffs of federal workers have fomented unease on Wall Street.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent. After weeks of selling, the index is now down 10.1 percent from a peak that was reached less than one month ago and is in a correction — a Wall Street term for when an index falls 10 percent or more from its peak, and a line in the sand for investors worried about a sell-off gathering steam.

Other major indexes, including the Russell 2000 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, had already fallen into correction before Thursday.

The deeper worry among investors is that uncertainty around the effects of Mr. Trump’s policies is causing consumers to spend less and discouraging businesses from investing. That reticence could, in turn, drive the economy into a downturn, forcing investors to re-evaluate company valuations.

“I think what markets are telling us is that they are very concerned about the potential for a recession,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “That is certainly not what markets expected going into 2025.”

So far, the administration has brushed off the market turmoil. Scott Bessent, secretary of the U.S. Treasury, said on Thursday that he was focused on the “real economy”, downplaying signals sent by business leaders and investors. “I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks,” he said.

As stocks have been falling in recent weeks, the Trump Administration has emphasized that its economic policies are designed to promote job growth over the long term, but could cause some market turmoil in the near term.

Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the economy has already begun to be “negatively impacted.”

The pain has been acutely felt among the behemoth tech companies that had driven the market higher in recent years but have since reversed course. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has fallen roughly 14 percent from its peak in December.

The sell-off has also spread to other corners of the market, signaling broader concerns than simply a re-pricing of highly valued technology companies. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which are typically more exposed to the ups and downs of the economy, has fallen 18 percent from its peak in November, close to a fully fledged bear market, defined as a drop of 20 percent or more from its peak.

Sectors of the stock market exposed to tariffs, like food producers, have slumped. The effects are being felt on other companies, like airlines, that are worried about a pullback among consumers should the economy enter a downturn.

“So far in 2025, the U.S. economy has only faced headwinds,” Ms. Shah said.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump threatened to impose 200 percent tariffs on European wine and champagne, one day after the European Union announced retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. whiskey and several other American products. The president has already added tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and a wide swath of products from China.

The constantly moving goal posts have left investors so rattled that even recent good news about the economy hasn’t had a calming effect. On Thursday, a report on weekly unemployment claims came in lower than expected. On Wednesday, a better-than-expected reading of the Consumer Price Index had briefly helped bolster stocks.

Investors are worried that tariffs, once in full effect, will push prices higher — hurting business and consumers. Mr. Trump’s immigration policies and firings of federal employees through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are also looming in the backdrop, as is the threat of an impending government shutdown.

“The outlook for inflation depends more on tariffs, deportations and DOGE than the backward-looking data releases right now,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said on Thursday.

The 35% reduction refers to the number of managers who oversee fewer than three people, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the details are private.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai weighed in, reiterating the need for the company “to be more efficient as we scale up so we don’t solve everything with headcount.”

Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023, and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year, said in October that she would push cost cuts “a little further.” Google has offered buyouts to employees since January, and the company has slowed hiring, asking employees to do more with less.

> Here’s how the company did compared with LSEG estimates: Earnings per share: 36 cents vs. 25 cents expected Revenue: $428 million vs. $405 million expected

> Global daily active uniques, or DAUq, rose 39% from a year earlier to an average of 101.7 million for the fourth quarter. That trailed Wall Street estimates of 103.1 million. A Google search algorithm change caused some “volatility” with user growth in fourth quarter, but the company’s search-related traffic has since recovered in the first quarter, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said in a letter to shareholders. “What happened wasn’t unusual — referrals from search fluctuate from time to time, and they primarily affect logged-out users,” Huffman wrote. 

> “Our teams have navigated numerous algorithm updates and did an excellent job adapting to these latest changes effectively.” Reddit has benefited from Google search updates and internal site improvements that have helped it gain a significant amount of new and returning users, which the social company refers to as logged-out users, over the past year and a half. Reddit has said it is working to convince logged-out users to create accounts as logged-in users, which are more lucrative for its business. Global logged-in DAUq grew 27% year over year to 46.1 million in the quarter while global logged-out DAUq rose 51% to 55.6 million, the company said.

> Despite missing on user number, the company otherwise reported a strong quarter and provided optimistic guidance.

This trend is likely to accelerate within the next 24 months in Usa. With major cuts expected in the NYSE AI listed companies, significant profits can be made. AI teams will be affected too. A tale of a snake eating its own tail and flesh.

But with the size of the China workforce in a country that produces more than one million engineers yearly, and with the expected rise of unemployment and accelerating AI mechanics , we might be at the dawn of a geopolitical shift in china and a redefinition of the power imbalance between low cost production countries and emerging low cost production countries in all continents.

Jobs average lifespan for employees getting lower and lower. From lifetime jobs more than 60 years ago to 1 month lifespan very soon.

For the hard or brick and mortar stuff, wouldn’t be surprised in the near future, if technologies companies which typically don’t pay dividends on consistent basis morph into  structures like REITs ( Real Estate Investment Trusts) and become REITs( Robots Ecosystems Industrial Trusts). You buy a stock of a company owning robots and the entity will pay you monthly dividends; but instead of a bond like return growing slowly, Dividends increase on yearly basis will be more substantial given AI efficiencies. The valuation of these IT companies will be more marketable using the dividend growth model.

Google banned the ultra-nationalist Tsargrad channel from YouTube in 2020, in response to US sanctions imposed against its owner, but after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 more channels were added to the banned list. 

The court imposed a 100,000 rubles per day, equivalent to about $1,025, with the total fine doubling every week. Thanks to the compound interest Google has now racked up a fine which the Russian judge on Monday called ‘a case in which there are many, many zeroes’. There are so many zeroes, in fact that the total fine amount completely dwarfs global GDP, which the World Bank estimates at about $100trillion.

Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) stock could drop between 15% and 25% if US District Judge Amit Mehta orders Google to sell off its Chrome browser, Barclays analysts wrote in a note to investors Monday.

In August 2024, Google lost a landmark antitrust trial against the US Department of Justice. Judge Mehta found the tech giant guilty of monopolizing the search engine market — specifically, the markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text"" ads, which are ones that appear at the top of the search results page, Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Keenan reported.

Last Friday, Google and the Department of Justice wrapped up closing arguments in the remedies phase of the case. The Department of Justice argued that Mehta should force Google to divest its web browser, Chrome, and share its search data with rivals as well as ban its exclusivity agreements that secure Google as the default search engine on mobile devices and browsers, Keenan and Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley reported.

Barclays analyst Ross Sandler wrote in a Monday note that “the probability of a Chrome divestiture, while low, has increased in our view,” following the closing arguments, adding that “the most likely candidates” to buy Chrome would be “well funded AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic or perhaps Perplexity.”

Sandler said such an outcome would be “a major blow” to Google, given that Chrome has 4 billion users and represents 35% of Google’s search revenue.

“This would be a major development, a black swan event for GOOGL shares,” he said. “Shares would obviously trade off significantly if this were to play out as no investors we speak to are thinking this remedy plays out.”

Sandler said a Chrome divestiture would not only cause Alphabet stock to tumble as much as 25% but would also result in a potential 30% hit to Alphabet’s earnings per share.

“The reality is we don't know what the court is going to decide on remedies, we listened to the entire day of closing arguments and there were certainly times where we felt a lot worse than we did prior, and other times where we felt better (in terms of GOOGL stock price impact),” Sandler said. He holds an Overweight rating on the stock.

Mehta is expected to decide on a remedy in the case — and the fate of Google’s search empire — in August. Google said Saturday that it will appeal the case.

Separately on Monday, Alphabet said it agreed to spend $500 million to change its compliance structure in order to settle a case with shareholders accusing the company of antitrust violations.

> Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks Apple “[hasn’t] really invented anything great in a while” and that it has been coasting off of its past success. “Steve Jobs invented the iPhone and now they’re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later,” he said this week. Zuckerberg made the statements during a nearly three-hour long podcast with Joe Rogan where, along with discussing Meta’s moderation policy changes and turn against diversity and inclusion policies, they got into Meta’s beef with Apple and its policies.

> The conversation actually started with Rogan’s issues with Apple. Rogan said he’s moving “from Apple to Android” in part because he doesn’t “like being attached to one company.” He also isn’t a fan of Apple’s App Store policies. “The way they do that Apple store, where they charge people 30 percent,” he said. “That seems so insane that they can get away with doing that.” “I have some opinions about this,” Zuckerberg said. While he gives credit to the iPhone as “obviously one of the most important inventions probably of all time,” he argued that Apple has put rules in place that “feel arbitrary.” Zuckerberg said that Apple has “thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way” as Apple’s own products, like the AirPods. If Apple let other people use its protocol, “there would probably be much better competitors to AirPods out there,” Zuckerberg said.

> Down the line, Zuckerberg envisions a world where you’ll be able to use the neural interface wristband and the glasses to text a friend or an AI and have the glasses give you the answer. He also believes that as smart glasses or even contact lenses as a computing platform become more developed, the internet will be “overlaid” on the physical world. “I think we’ll basically be in this wild world where most of the world will be physical, but there will be this increasing amount of virtual objects or people who are beaming in or hologramming into different things to interact in different ways,” he said. “There isn’t a physical world and a digital world anymore,” he added. “We’re in 2025. It’s one world.”",917

Tesla is not outpacing other companies, other companies are actually catching up to them in the ways they have been growing.

Also, keep in mind that Musk just pissed off about 50 million democrats who were Tesla's existing core customer base. Multiple people at my work who own Tesla's have said they are now embarrassed to own a Tesla.

The speculation is partly based on Tesla's currently nonexistent and delayed automated taxi company. Let's put how weak Tesla's position in perspective.

Tesla plans to open an automated taxi company in Austin Texas this summer. 1 city.  Waymo (owned by Google) started in it's first city 8 years ago and is planning on expanding from 3 cities (San Fransisco, LA, and Pheonix) to 12 over the next year. Tesla is almost a decade behind in this industry and are not in a good position to dominate it or reach fully non city dependent fully automated driving in any way. There is also absolutely no indication that their business model is in a better position than their competitors in this industry currently.

For this current Market cap to be realized, Tesla would essentially need to come to control the majority of 3 major industries while Musk is sitting around playing video games for 12 hours a day (according to him) and playing politician in the Trump administration.",858

1nxidln,2025-10-04 04:34:33,Reddit,stocks,GOOGL,Reddit (RDDT) - Everyone’s Missing What Actually Happened,"
Position: Long 1 contract, Jan 2026 $210 Call (+$362.50)

TL;DR: The 7% drop from “ChatGPT citations declining” is the most misunderstood selloff I’ve seen this year. Google just handed Reddit pricing power on a silver platter.

-----

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED:

Sept 10: Google kills num=100 parameter
→ Search APIs can only pull 10-20 results instead of 100
→ Reddit content (ranked 11-100) disappears from scraped data
→ ChatGPT citations drop from 14% to 2%
→ Stock tanks from $240 to $207

Wall Street sees: “Reddit losing AI relevance”

I see: “Reddit just got monopoly pricing on their content”

-----

THE SETUP EVERYONE’S MISSING:

Before: OpenAI scraped Reddit for free via Google

After: OpenAI must pay Reddit directly for API access

This isn’t Reddit losing value. This is Google eliminating Reddit’s free rider problem.

THE MATH:

Current confirmed deals:

- Google: $60M/year
- OpenAI: ~$60M/year
- Total AI licensing run rate: $200M+

They’re negotiating “dynamic pricing” = pay per use

If usage drives pricing and free access just got killed, what happens to those numbers?

Do the math. It’s not going down.

-----

THE CITATION DROP ACTUALLY PROVES THE THESIS:

Stock moved 14% on an 86% citation drop.

Think about that.

One metric from one AI platform moved a $30B company 14%.

That’s not weakness. That’s dependency.

ChatGPT can’t function without Reddit’s UGC. Neither can Perplexity. Neither can Google’s AI.

They just lost free access.

Now they pay, or their AI gets dumber.

-----

WHY REDDIT WINS THIS:

1. Content moat nobody can replicate

- 100M daily users having real conversations
- Every niche topic covered
- Continuously updated
- 18 years of archived knowledge

1. Q2 fundamentals crushed it

- $501M revenue (+84% YoY)
- Just turned profitable
- 97M DAU (+51% YoY)
- Positive free cash flow

1. AI companies have no alternatives

- Stack Overflow? Smaller, tech-only
- Quora? Dead
- Discord? Private, not indexed
- Twitter? Toxic wasteland
- Where else do you get quality UGC at scale?

1. Google just eliminated their competition

- Can’t scrape Reddit via Google anymore
- Must use Reddit’s direct API
- Reddit sets the price

-----

THE BEAR CASE (because I’m not an idiot):

- Negotiations could fail
- OpenAI might reduce Reddit dependency
- Valuation still rich at 8x sales
- User experience degrading from over-monetization
- Competition could emerge

These are real risks. I’m not ignoring them.

But the risk/reward at $207 after a panic sell on misunderstood news?

That’s the setup I want.

-----

WHAT I’M WATCHING:

Bullish catalysts:

- New OpenAI deal announced (higher rates)
- Q3 earnings showing AI revenue acceleration
- Additional platform partnerships
- Dynamic pricing implementation

Bearish catalysts:

- Failed negotiations
- User growth slowdown
- Continued citation decline without revenue growth
- Management fumbling this opportunity

-----

MY ACTUAL THESIS:

The market saw “citations down” and panic sold.

Smart money should see “free access eliminated, paid access mandatory.”

Google didn’t hurt Reddit. Google just forced every AI company to negotiate directly with Reddit.

And Reddit owns content nobody else has.

That’s pricing power.

The Jan 2026 $210 call gives me:

- 3 months to see Q3 earnings
- Time for new deal announcements
- Exposure to re-rating if market figures this out
- Limited downside (premium paid)

This is 2% of my portfolio. High conviction on thesis, sized appropriately for execution risk.

-----

What am I missing? Where’s the hole in this logic?

Genuinely want to stress test this before adding to the position.

Not financial advice. I own calls. Do your own research.

But if you think I’m wrong, tell me why in the comments.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",815

So Microsoft can brag this is AI revenue when we know the reality is people are being forced to buy co-pilot to have Office.

Even if we assume people want to pay for co-pilot it’s revenue is microscopic compared to the amount of money Microsoft is paying for AI.

Now, for those asking for charts, crayons, or simplified pictures—just a heads-up: this sub doesn’t support image uploads. So if you're looking for visual aids, you’ll need to do a bit of homework and look up the references and data I mention here. Trust me, it’s worth your time.

Also, there will be no TL;DR at the end of this post. If you’re someone who can’t—or won’t—read through a detailed explanation, then this probably isn’t for you. The economy, and the factors that influence how a stock moves, are complex. If you're not willing to engage with that complexity, you’re setting yourself up to get burned. So, with that said, let’s dive in.

This comment caught me by surprise because the numbers were totally made up. I have to go back and do some research because what he said wasn't true at all. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla's net income was $2.31 billion on revenues of $25.7 billion. During this period, the company earned $692 million from selling automotive regulatory credits. This revenue from regulatory credits represents approximately 30% of Tesla's net income for the quarter.

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/)

Tesla reported a 47% increase in 2024, totaling $1.57 billion for the year, up from $1.07 billion in 2023. While the exact figure for Q4 2024 isn't specified, if we assume the increase was evenly distributed, the quarterly interest income would be around $392.5 million. This would account for approximately 17% of the quarter's net income. Combining both regulatory credits and estimated interest income, these sources contributed approximately 47% of Tesla's net income in Q4 2024. The 70% is false information.

[https://www.captide.co/insights/tesla-q4-2024](https://www.captide.co/insights/tesla-q4-2024)

Now let's talk about sale of regulatory credits. These are *not actual cars sold*—they're a kind of *bonus revenue* Tesla earns because of how environmentally friendly its cars are. Governments around the world, especially in places like California and Europe, require automakers to sell a certain number of low-emission or zero-emission vehicles. If a car company doesn’t meet those requirements, they have to *buy credits* from companies that exceed the standard—like Tesla. Tesla earns a bunch of these credits because all its cars are electric. Then it sells them to other automakers who still rely on gas-powered cars. This is essentially free money for Tesla—it doesn’t cost them anything to generate these credits, but they can sell them for hundreds of millions of dollars.

As for interest income, this is money Tesla earns just for having cash in the bank or investments. Tesla holds billions in cash and short-term investments. Instead of letting it sit there, they invest it in safe, interest-earning instruments (like U.S. Treasury bonds or money market funds). This also include bitcoin. As interest rates rise, these earnings go up—so Tesla earns hundreds of millions per quarter just from letting their money sit and grow.

Remember what I said about bitcoin in the previous post? ""In December 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updated its guidelines, allowing companies to report digital assets like Bitcoin at their fair market value. This change enabled Tesla to recognize unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings without selling them. Leveraging the new accounting standards, Tesla reported a $600 million increase in net income for the fourth quarter of 2024, attributed to the appreciation of its Bitcoin holdings. This gain represented approximately 26% of Tesla's net income for that quarter. [https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060](https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060) If you have been paying attention to the price of bitcoin since Q2024, it has dropped dramatically. The next earnings are going to be really bad.

As of March 22, 2025, Bitcoin's price is approximately $84,123.

On December 31, 2024, (Tesla Q4 2024 earning) Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429. On December 31, 2024, Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429.""

If this number hold true, Tesla interest income from bitcoin will drop by 9.96%.

With that said, the saying that Tesla doesn't make money from car isn't true. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla's automotive sales revenue—which includes income from vehicle sales and related services—totaled approximately $18.8 billion. This figure represents about 73% of Tesla's total revenue of $25.7 billion for the same period. For the entire year of 2024, Tesla's automotive sales revenue amounted to $72.5 billion, accounting for approximately 74% of the total annual revenue of $97.7 billion. Remember the stuff about regulator credit above? These percentages indicate that automotive sales remain the primary contributor to Tesla's revenue, both quarterly and annually. Tesla is still a car company at heart, and this was it moat.

You might not know this about me, but I used to be a hardcore Tesla fanboy. I invested in the company back when they were just producing the original Roadster. Over the years, I’ve owned *every single product* Tesla has put out—including four of their vehicles.

Tesla’s sky-high valuation wasn’t just hype—it was because the company was doing things no one else dared to. It was more than just an automaker; it was positioned as a tech and AI company, with aspirations in robotics and full self-driving. But even beyond that, Tesla was pioneering a completely new model of vertical integration.

It wasn’t just about selling electric cars. Tesla popularized EVs, achieved massive adoption rates, and built an entire ecosystem around the vehicle. They sold their own insurance, handled their own repairs, created and *standardized* their own charging port (which others later adopted), and developed the most expansive EV charging network in the world.

Elon Musk wasn’t just building a car company—he was positioning Tesla to be the Rockefeller of the 21st-century automotive industry. Just like how Rockefeller controlled the oil pipeline from extraction to distribution, Tesla was aiming to control everything:

* Design and manufacturing of the vehicles
* Repair and servicing (only Tesla could repair a Tesla)
* Insurance and financing
* And the “gas stations” of the future—their Supercharger network

It was a brilliant playbook, and it echoed what made Sony so dominant in the 1990s: Sony owned the formats. Whether it was CDs, MiniDiscs, Blu-ray, or the Walkman headphone jack, Sony created the platforms and *collected royalties* when others used them.

Had Tesla stayed on that course—doubling down on ecosystem control and technological dominance—they truly had a shot at owning the entire EV industry. But somewhere along the way, they pivoted, and that vision started to drift.

I was a fanboy of Tesla, and I sold everything in November. I also started shorting Spy, but hopefully, I have time to talk about the economy in this post.

What truly broke the long-term vision for Tesla, in my eyes, was the company’s decision to step back from its charging station expansion—the very dream of becoming the next-generation energy empire, replacing Shell, Chevron, Mobil, and essentially every gas station in the world.

In late April 2024, Tesla made a dramatic internal shift by disbanding its entire Supercharger team, including its leader, Rebecca Tinucci. This wasn’t a small reorganization—it was a major strategic reversal. The move immediately sparked concern about the future of Tesla’s vast charging infrastructure, which had once been one of its most significant competitive advantages.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla\_Supercharger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Supercharger)

In response, Elon Musk stated that Tesla would still grow its Supercharger network—but at a much slower pace. The new focus would be on maintaining 100% uptime and expanding existing sites, rather than continuing the rapid rollout of new stations across the country and around the world. This change came as part of broader company-wide layoffs and a growing strategic pivot toward artificial intelligence and robotics.

[https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-explains-reasoning-behind-tesla-supercharger-team-disband/](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-explains-reasoning-behind-tesla-supercharger-team-disband/)

For Tesla’s automotive partners—like Ford, GM, and Rivian, who had recently committed to adopting Tesla’s NACS charging standard—this sudden shift caused confusion and uncertainty. They had signed on with the expectation that Tesla would continue leading the way in EV infrastructure. Now, that future looked far less clear.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-disbands-tesla-ev-charging-team-leaving-customers-dark-2024-04-30/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-disbands-tesla-ev-charging-team-leaving-customers-dark-2024-04-30/)

As a Tesla owner in California, where EV adoption is highest, I’ve already started to see the consequences firsthand. Fewer new charging stations are being built, and the reliability of existing ones is noticeably declining. Increasingly, I encounter broken or malfunctioning Superchargers—something that used to be rare. In some locations, the charging speeds are significantly slower than they used to be—sometimes even half as fast.

On top of that, Tesla has introduced energy usage-based time rates, and the cost of charging has surged. What used to be a convenient and cost-effective option now feels like a premium-priced service. Three years ago, I used Superchargers without thinking twice. Today, I charge almost exclusively at home—because it’s five to eight times cheaper. Furthermore, you have to think about the high cost of housing and the majority of people renting or living in an apartment. They would have all had to use the Tesla charging stations for every EV car. Think about this implication!

**The bigger picture here is that Elon Musk had the chance to be a modern-day Rockefeller. He was on track to own the entire energy pipeline for electric vehicles: manufacturing the cars, selling the insurance, controlling the repairs, and operating the “gas stations” of the EV era through the Supercharger network.**

But that opportunity has slipped away. The dream of Tesla owning the entire EV ecosystem—end to end—has fractured. And it’s hard not to see this as a major strategic misstep.

u/Qc4281 ""I believe the Bulls are putting all of their hope in robotaxis and regardless of Q1, June will be the real test of how much support Tesla continues to have.""

It’s time to face a hard truth: Tesla is no longer on the cutting edge of robotaxi technology. As of 2025, the undisputed leader in autonomous ride-hailing is Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google’s parent company).

Waymo operates at SAE Level 4 autonomy, meaning their vehicles can drive themselves without any human inside, in specific geofenced areas. This isn’t a prototype—it’s real, operational, and public.

Their Waymo One robotaxi service is live in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, where anyone can hail a fully driverless car—no safety driver, no steering wheel input, no human control required. Riders are using it every day like a regular Uber or Lyft.

In contrast, Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving (FSD) is still classified as Level 2 autonomy. That means the system can assist with steering, acceleration, and braking, but the driver must be fully alert and ready to take over at all times. Tesla has no regulatory approval to operate a robotaxi fleet, and no Tesla on the road today can legally drive itself.

Waymo uses a sophisticated sensor fusion approach:

* Lidar for detailed 3D mapping
* Radar for object detection in poor visibility
* High-definition maps to understand complex city layouts

Tesla, by contrast, has removed radar and relies exclusively on cameras and neural networks, a vision-only system. While Tesla claims this mimics human driving, it’s also less reliable in poor lighting, bad weather, or unpredictable road scenarios. Waymo has logged over 20 million miles on public roads and released a detailed 2023 safety report showing zero major injuries or fatalities across millions of fully autonomous rides.

Elon Musk has been promising Level 4 or even Level 5 autonomy “next year” since 2016—nearly a decade of delays. As of today, FSD Beta still requires constant supervision. Tesla has not submitted its system to any regulatory body (e.g., DMV or NHTSA) for approval as an autonomous driving platform. No Tesla vehicle qualifies as a robotaxi, and none are legally allowed to operate as such

Tesla can't jump straight to Level 4. It first needs to prove Level 3, where the car can drive itself under limited conditions without driver input—but even that milestone has not been reached. It’s based more on hope and hype than actual technical progress or regulatory reality. Tesla has a powerful brand, and Elon’s ambitious promises get attention—but when it comes to real-world robotaxi deployment, Waymo is years ahead.

Now we can talk about the robot. Boston Dynamics and Tesla’s Optimus are both developing humanoid robots. Boston Dynamic Has been developing humanoid and quadruped robots for **over a decade**. Their humanoid robot, Atlas, can run, jump, do parkour, backflips, and handle complex terrain. Their quadruped robot, Spot, is already being used in real industrial environments—construction sites, factories, even police and research teams.

Tesla first unveiled Optimus in 2021as a concept, with actual development starting in 2022. Still in early prototype stages—Tesla has shown it walking, lifting objects, and folding clothes, but it’s not yet capable of dynamic movement like Atlas. As of 2025, it’s still being tested internally and isn’t commercially deployed.

Boston Dynamics is years ahead in terms of real-world functionality.

I think I’ve looked into this deeply enough to respond to the common claim that “Tesla is more than just a car company.” The truth is, Tesla *was* more than just a car company. It had a bold vision—revolutionizing energy, transportation, and robotics all at once.

But that vision has faded.

Today, Tesla has lost much of its momentum under Elon Musk’s shifting priorities. Right now, it's essentially an overvalued car company that’s trying to break into the robotaxi and robotics space—fields where it's already years, if not a decade, behind the actual industry leaders.

The ambition is still there—but the execution no longer matches the hype.

Now, this isn't to say that Tesla will be going down in the next months or two. I noticed many of the people who are reading the previous post didn't understand what I was talking about when I was talking about LPSY. Specifically, I was referring to the Wyckoff distribution schematic phase c-d LPSY. Phase C is the test. The ‘Test’ serves the same but opposite function as the ‘Spring’ in the accumulation phase: the bull trap before the downtrend. While this level does get broken, it doesn’t change the picture of the cycle. Phase D is the effect. Phase D in this distribution phase is a mirror image of Phase D in the accumulation cycle. There is a considerable surge in volume and volatility, comprising one or more Last Point of Supply (LPSY) points. A Sign of Weakness (SOW) level happens, the final indication that the bears will soon take center stage. You have to open up tradingview or similar program to draw this, but it looks like Tesla is currently in that phase.

[https://www.tradersmastermind.com/wyckoff-method/](https://www.tradersmastermind.com/wyckoff-method/)

The LPSY (Last Point of Supply) is a critical stage in the Wyckoff distribution schematic where rallies begin to fail, unable to reach previous highs. During this phase, we typically expect to see a short-term rally, but it’s often weak and unsustainable. Volume behavior becomes a major red flag—buying volume dries up on the way up, while selling volume increases during pullbacks. This pattern suggests that institutions have already completed their distribution, leaving retail traders to buy the dip, unaware that the “smart money” has exited. As a result, the stock becomes highly vulnerable to a sharp decline.

In Tesla’s case, these signs are already becoming visible. We’re seeing a pattern of lower highs, indicating that each rebound is losing strength. Key support levels are eroding, and momentum is fading, even in response to what would typically be considered “good news.” At the same time, narrative fatigue is setting in—delays in the robotaxi rollout, slowing delivery growth, ongoing price cuts, and Tesla’s recent pullback from expanding its Supercharger network have all contributed to weakening sentiment. All of this points to Tesla potentially being in its LPSY phase, teetering on the edge of a deeper markdown.

One thing we often overlook when talking about Tesla is its status as a luxury brand, which brings us back to the broader conversation about the economy. Before I go any further, I want to be clear: I’m praying that I’m wrong. I don’t *want* the economy to crash. But I’ve lived through a recession before—and I remember it vividly.

Back in 2008, I watched family and friends lose their businesses, homes, jobs, savings—and in some cases, even loved ones. The pain was real. And what made it worse was knowing that much of it happened while our government and institutions downplayed the risks or outright lied to the public. That experience has shaped the way I look at economic data today.

Right now, I believe we're entering a recession—or at the very least, staring down a serious economic slowdown. I'm not writing this to tell you to sell all your stocks or panic. I’m sharing this because I hope you’ll take a step back, assess your risks, and plan accordingly.

According to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a recession is defined as a significant decline in economic activity that is widespread and lasts for more than a few months. It typically shows up in multiple indicators: GDP, personal income, employment, industrial production, and retail sales. There's also a more technical (but less comprehensive) definition: two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth.

During the 2008 financial crisis, the earliest warning signs appeared in November 2007, which the NBER later marked as the official start of the recession. At that time, major financial institutions began reporting huge losses on mortgage-backed securities, job growth slowed, consumer confidence dropped, and the stock market—which had peaked in October 2007—began to decline. Subprime lenders were collapsing, and credit was tightening across the board.

By mid-2008, the crisis accelerated: Bear Stearns collapsed in March, and Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September. Housing prices plummeted, unemployment surged, and the economy spiraled. If you had exited the market in November 2007, you would not have seen the S&P 500 return to the same level until May 2011. That’s 3.5 years of waiting—and that's assuming you had the ability to hold through it all. This matters because knowing when to cut losses can save years of financial recovery, unless you're okay with sitting on those losses for the long haul.

I still remember watching Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, downplay the risks in the housing market and broader economy. Despite clear signs of overheating in credit and housing, he failed to act—ignoring warnings from economists, regulators, and data. That experience is why I don’t place my faith in Jerome Powell or any official narrative. I trust only the numbers.

Looking ahead, the week of March 24–30 will give us key economic data. On Wednesday, we’ll get the Durable Goods Orders report. The forecast is -0.7%, compared to last month’s +3.1%. If it comes in even lower, that’s significant—because durable goods (like cars, appliances, aircraft, and machinery) are only purchased when businesses and consumers feel confident. A steep drop in this number is a classic early warning sign of a recession. However, durable goods alone don’t tell the full story—it needs to be paired with rising unemployment, falling retail sales, and declining industrial production to form a full recessionary picture.

On Thursday, we’ll see the GDP growth rate (QoQ). It was 3.0% in September and 3.1% in December. The projection now is 2.3%. If it misses expectations and drops even lower, we may not officially “ring the recession bell” just yet—but June’s data will become pivotal. That's when things may start to shift into ""oh-shit"" mode.

Then on Friday, we’ll get personal income and personal spending figures. These are crucial. If both decline, that’s another strong recession signal. Personal spending accounts for nearly 70% of U.S. GDP, and if consumers stop spending, the economy slows—simple as that. Personal income tells us how much financial cushion people have. When both metrics go down, it shows growing financial stress among households.

For the week of March 31–April 6, we’ll get more insight with ISM Services PMI on Thursday, and then non-farm payrolls and the unemployment rate on Friday. Forecasts haven’t been released yet, but if these numbers also disappoint—especially in combination with all the metrics above—we’ll be staring at a textbook recession setup. These are the early signs, and I’m laying them out not to scare you, but to prepare you.

You may think I’m being overly cautious, and I could absolutely be wrong. And honestly—I hope I am. But the question you have to ask yourself is: Are you willing to risk losing 50% of your savings just to see if I’m wrong?

Looking back at 2008, throughout most of 2007 and early 2008, the Bush administration repeatedly said the economy was “fundamentally sound,” even as the housing and credit markets collapsed beneath them. In January 2008, President Bush acknowledged “economic challenges” but still refused to call it a recession. And by the time the government acted decisively, it was already too late for millions of families.

This isn’t about being Republican or Democrat. It’s about making sure the words our officials say line up with what the numbers are telling us. If they don’t—we need to learn from history and not fall into the same trap. We can’t afford to get scammed into losing our life savings again.

Let’s circle back to the topic of Tesla as a luxury brand—because that’s an important lens to view its current position through. Do you remember what happened during the 2008 financial crisis? Both automobile sales and luxury goods took a massive hit. Consumers cut back sharply on big-ticket purchases, and the luxury sector—cars, fashion, jewelry, travel—was no exception.

If you haven’t already, take a look at LVMH, the world’s largest luxury conglomerate. Its stock has dropped significantly, reflecting weakening demand for high-end consumer goods. This is a telling sign. Now ask yourself—what about Airbnb (ABNB)? Another brand that, while not traditionally “luxury,” thrives on discretionary income and consumer confidence. It’s also seeing a decline, which suggests people are pulling back on travel and experiences—another luxury-like behavior.

Then there’s the VIX, the so-called “fear index” that tracks market volatility. If you examine the chart, you’ll notice that it’s starting to resemble the early stages of 2008—with rising spikes and volatility building quietly under the surface.

Some may argue that it also looks like 2020, when COVID-19 triggered a global economic shutdown. But the key difference is that in 2020, the whole world was impacted simultaneously—the pandemic was a shared crisis that brought coordinated government responses, massive stimulus, and a V-shaped recovery.

This time is different. What we’re seeing now is primarily an American problem—rooted in sticky inflation, rising consumer debt, eroding household savings, and waning confidence in domestic institutions and policy. Other countries aren't yet showing the same systemic stress.

So when we talk about Tesla, or any luxury-adjacent brand, we have to recognize that luxury spending is one of the first things to be cut when consumers feel insecure. And the signs—from LVMH to ABNB to the VIX—are stacking up. This isn’t fear-mongering. It’s pattern recognition.

Lastly—and I want to emphasize this—I'm not saying the sky is falling, nor am I predicting that the stock market is going to crash tomorrow. In fact, I actually believe the market may move upward in the short term due to momentum, technicals, or temporary optimism.

However, looking beyond the next few weeks, I believe the economic data over the next six months will begin to confirm what many of us already feel: that a recession is likely on the horizon. In particular, I think the next three months will be the most revealing. The trends we see in that window—whether in job growth, consumer spending, durable goods, or inflation—will be the “tell” that it's time for investors to start protecting their assets and reassessing their positions.

You don't need to sell everything. But you do need to have a plan. Because once the data becomes undeniable, the window to exit cleanly and safely may close fast.

Thank you for taking the time to read my posts. I had planned to dive into other topics, but honestly, there’s so much unfolding right now that it’s hard to keep it all focused. I genuinely feel for those who are still holding on, caught in the sunken cost fallacy, hoping things will bounce back simply because they’ve already lost so much.

Just remember: losing less is always better than losing more. Sometimes survival in the market isn’t about timing the top or the bottom—it’s about knowing when to step aside and preserve what you have.

As always, I welcome your thoughts, counterpoints, or insights. Let’s navigate this together.",792

1h9thrg,2024-12-08 22:35:35,Reddit,stocks,GOOGL,‘My heart is in Amazon’: Jeff Bezos returns to Amazon’s frontlines with a focus on AI,"“Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and former CEO, has re-emerged as a driving force at the tech giant, dedicating 95% of his time to advancing artificial intelligence initiatives. Speaking at the DealBook Summit on Wednesday, Bezos expressed his enduring connection to the company he founded 30 years ago, even after stepping down as CEO in 2021.

“My heart is in Amazon, my curiosity is in Amazon, and my fears are there, and my love is there,” Bezos said, reinforcing his deep ties to the company and its mission.

Bezos’s renewed focus on AI comes as Amazon seeks to assert itself in the rapidly evolving technology landscape. The company is currently developing over 1,000 internal AI applications and aims to leverage this momentum to remain competitive with industry giants like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI.

One of the cornerstone projects under Bezos’s watch involves building a cutting-edge supercomputer in partnership with Anthropic, the AI startup in which Amazon recently invested $8 billion. This supercomputer is expected to power a multimodal AI model capable of analysing images, video, and text, further enhancing Amazon’s AI capabilities.

Although Bezos stepped down as CEO to focus on his space venture, Blue Origin, he continues to serve as Amazon’s executive chairman, actively supporting CEO Andy Jassy and the leadership team. His involvement mirrors a broader trend of tech founders, such as Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin, returning to their companies to steer AI-focused strategies.

“I’ll always be there to help, and right now, I’m putting a lot of time into it,” Bezos said. “It’s super interesting, so why not?”

Amazon’s AI ambitions are supported by significant investments in infrastructure and talent. The company is betting big on the transformative potential of artificial intelligence to enhance its services and operations, positioning itself as a serious contender in the ongoing AI race.

Bezos’s hands-on approach signals his commitment to Amazon’s future during this pivotal time in technological innovation. His involvement aligns with the company’s broader goals of integrating AI into various aspects of its operations, from customer service to cloud computing.

Bezos’s renewed focus on Amazon coincides with a surge in his net worth, which reached $228 billion last month, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The increase was driven by Amazon’s stock hitting a record $207.09 per share, boosting Bezos’s wealth by $7 billion as he continues to hold nearly 9% of the company.”

Alphabet Inc.’s Google was fined almost €3 billion ($3.5 billion) by the European Union and ordered to stop favoring its own advertising technology services, in a move that risks further inflaming tensions with US President Donald Trump.
The European Commission said Friday that Google had abused its dominance by giving its own ad exchanges a competitive advantage over rivals and that it must bring the practices to an end.

“When markets fail, public institutions must act to prevent dominant players from abusing their power,” EU antitrust commissioner Teresa Ribera said in a statement. “True freedom means a level playing field, where everyone competes on equal terms and citizens have a genuine right to choose.”

The company immediately vowed to appeal. Lee-Anne Mulholland, vice president for regulatory affairs at Google, said the move “imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money.”

The EU punishment comes at a tense moment for EU–US trade relations, with Trump repeatedly deriding the bloc’s efforts to rein in Silicon Valley giants. Although Google faces antitrust scrutiny worldwide, it won some relief this week when a US judge ruled that its search business would not need to be broken up to address the harms alleged by the Department of Justice.

Google’s adtech operations, however, also remain under threat in the US. The DOJ is expected to file proposed remedies later on Friday, ahead of a Sept. 22 hearing on those proposals. Previously, the department had floated forcing Google to divest its Ad Manager platform to tackle the alleged anticompetitive risks.

The EU warned Google in 2023 that it had abused its dominance in advertising technology to harm online publishers. At the time, the Brussels-based commission said Google had favored its own ad exchange program over its rivals and bolstered the company’s central role in the ad tech supply chain.
Ribera’s predecessor Margrethe Vestager warned then that only a “mandatory divestment” of part of its business would solve the issues. The Dane had spent a decade in Brussels, where she hit Google with fines of more than €8 billion across three different cases, although one penalty was annulled and another cut by EU judges.",708

SVP Rick Osterloh sent out a memo to employees this morning about the “voluntary exit program,” and the company confirmed to 9to5Google that this is happening.

This program applies to US employees working on Platforms & Devices, which includes Android (Auto, TV, Wear OS, XR), Chrome, ChromeOS, Google Photos, Google One, Pixel, Fitbit, and Nest. Google has many people around the world working on these products, but today’s announcement is just for those stateside.

Meanwhile, this is not a company-wide offer that applies to Search, AI, or other groups, though Alphabet’s new CFO last October said “driving further efficiencies” was a key priority.

Separately, software and hardware were already two very large organizations, with some overlap. Now that things have settled in recent months, employees have a better idea of their roles. Osterloh said the division received questions about the possibility of voluntary exits since the Pixel-Android merger. Not offering people the option to leave in advance was a complaint about how Google handled past layoffs.

The memo frames this exit program as being beneficial for those who might not be aligned or passionate about the combined organization’s mission or are having difficulty with their roles, and hybrid working requirements. 

In leaving Google, employees will get a severance package, with more details internally coming soon. From what we learned, this program does not coincide with any product roadmap changes. 

Before the merger, the Google hardware division last January switched to a functional organization model where there is one team (and leader) for teams like hardware engineering across Pixel, Nest, and Fitbit. At the same time, a few hundred roles were cut. The broader unification in April was designed to “speed up decision-making” internally. 

In offering this program today, Google wants employees “to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency.” The statement also makes reference to “tremendous momentum” and “so much important work ahead.” Google’s full statement is below.

> The Platforms & Devices team is offering a voluntary exit program that provides US-based Googlers working on this team the ability to voluntarily leave the company with a severance package. This comes after we brought two large organizations together last year. There’s tremendous momentum on this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency.

1. is publicly traded

2. isn't already owned by big tech (Mag 7)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_most-visited\_websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-visited_websites)

Reddit is a destination site, unlike the Google/Bing/Wiki sites that rank in the top, which I see more as tools, and It is also relatively small at  less than $40B market cap today.

I remain bullish mainly because Reddit is becoming one of few properties where you can still find human generated content (yes, lots of bots, but still lots of real humans) that's not just about what your friend had for dinner.

In a world where internet content is increasing filled with AI slop, human content will become more valuable. So given the above, I think it's a no brainer to allocate a portion of my portfolio for long term hold.

Thank you for your attention in this matter.

1hudvgj,2025-01-05 19:42:33,Reddit,stocks,GOOGL,Thoughts on rumor that Google's Pichai is expected to resign in 2025,"Hey guys,

I came across a post that's currently trending on Blind about Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, potentially resigning in 2025. According to the post, large investors are pressuring Google's board to push Sundar out due to dissatisfaction with his performance, citing a string of failed projects and lack of foresight. 

The post suggests that Google's board might be amenable to this pressure, and we could see a resignation announcement as soon as this summer, or earlier if more investors join in on the pressure. They're even talking about securing his replacement already. 


What do you all think about this? Is it believable that Sundar Pichai might step down? How would this affect Google's stock price? 

TL;DR: Rumors are circulating that Sundar Pichai might resign from Google due to investor pressure. What are your thoughts on this development?",639

Microsoft on Wednesday announced Majorana 1, its first quantum computing chip. 

The achievement comes after the company has spent nearly two decades of research in the field. 

Technologists believe quantum computers could one day efficiently solve problems that would be taxing if not impossible for classical computers. Today’s computers use bits that can be either on or off while quantum computers employ quantum bits, or qubits, that can operate in both states simultaneously.

Google and IBM have also developed quantum processors, as have smaller companies IonQ and Rigetti Computing. Microsoft’s quantum chip employs eight topological qubits using indium arsenide, which is a semiconductor, and aluminum, which is a superconductor. A new paper in the journal Nature describes the chip in detail.

Microsoft won’t be allowing clients to use its Majorana 1 chip through the company’s Azure public cloud, as it plans to do with its custom artificial intelligence chip, Maia 100. Instead, Majorana 1 is a step toward a goal of a million qubits on a chip, following extensive physics research.

Rather than rely on Taiwan Semiconductor or another company for fabrication, Microsoft is manufacturing the components of Majorana 1 itself in the U.S. That’s possible because the work is unfolding at a small scale.

“We want to get to a few hundred qubits before we start talking about commercial reliability,” Jason Zander, a Microsoft executive vice president, told CNBC.

In the meantime, the company will engage with national laboratories and universities on research using Majorana 1. 

Despite the focus on research, investors are fascinated by quantum.

IonQ shares went up 237% in 2024, and Rigetti gained nearly 1,500%. The two generated a combined $14.8 million in third-quarter revenue. Further gains came in January, after Microsoft issued a blog post declaring that 2025 is “the year to become quantum-ready.”

Microsoft’s Azure Quantum cloud service, which lets developers experiment with programs and algorithms, offers access to chips from IonQ and Rigetti. It’s possible that a Microsoft quantum chip might become available through Azure before 2030, Zander said.

“There’s a lot of speculation that we’re decades off from this,” he said. “We believe it’s more like years.”

Rather than exist as a stand-alone category, quantum computing might end up boosting other parts of Microsoft. For example, there’s Microsoft’s AI business, which has an annualized revenue run rate that exceeds $13 billion. Quantum computers could be used to build data used to train AI models, Zander said. 

“Now you can ask it to invent some new molecule, invent some new drug, something that really would have been impossible to do before,” Zander said.",591

* Cloud unit sales increase 19% for the third straight quarter

>Amazon.com Inc. warned investors that it could face capacity constraints in its cloud computing division despite plans to invest some $100 billion this year, with most of the money going toward data centers, homegrown chips and other equipment to provide artificial intelligence services.

>Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, determined to turn Amazon into an AI supermarket, is spending big to retain the company’s edge in cloud-computing services. Still, he warned growth would be “lumpy” owing to challenges securing sufficient hardware and electricity.

>“It is true we could be growing faster were it not for some of the constraints on capacity,” Jassy said on a conference call Thursday after the release of fourth-quarter results.

>The concerns echo those of rival Microsoft Corp., which last week said its cloud sales growth was hurt because it didn’t have enough data centers to handle demand for its AI products.

>Jassy said power capacity and the supply of chips — from third parties and Amazon’s own design unit — are limiting the ability of Amazon Web Services to bring new data centers online. Those constraints will likely ease in the second half of 2025, he said.

>Amazon spent $26.3 billion in capital expenditures in the last three months of 2024, the vast majority of which went toward AI-related projects within AWS. Jassy told analysts on the call that the amount was “reasonably representative” of the rate of outlays the company planned to make in 2025.

>The company reported that AWS revenue jumped 19% to $28.8 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. It was the third straight period of 19% growth for the cloud unit.

>“AWS growth did not accelerate as anticipated and instead matched Q3 levels, indicating that the company is challenged by the same types of capacity constraints facing rivals Google and Microsoft,” said Sky Canaves, an analyst at Emarketer.

>Jassy’s warning on AWS growth constraints overshadowed a fairly strong holiday quarter, suggesting the company’s main e-commerce and logistics business is fending off competition from Walmart Inc. and discount upstarts like Temu and Shein.

>The shares declined almost 3% as the markets opened on Friday in New York. The stock had previously gained 8.9% so far this year after a 44% jump in 2024.

>The AI race will likely weigh down profits. Operating income will be $14 billion to $18 billion in the period ending in March, the Seattle-based company said in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected $18.2 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. First-quarter sales will be as much as $155.5 billion, compared with an average estimate of $158.6 billion.

>While Amazon’s overall quarter was generally positive, “investors immediate concerns are around Q1 guidance, which was below expectations, mostly because of the impact of a big currency drag and the impact of lapping a leap year,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co. The company said the extra day in the quarter in 2024 boosted sales by about $1.5 billion.

>Total revenue in the holiday quarter increased 10% to $187.8 billion, slightly ahead of analyst estimates. Operating profit was $21.2 billion, compared with the average estimate of $18.8 billion.

>Total operating expenses rose 6.2% to $166.6 billion — marking the eighth consecutive quarter that Amazon’s revenue increased at a higher rate than costs. The company employed more than 1.55 million full- and part-time workers at the end of the quarter, a 2% increase from a year earlier.

1krh5ez,2025-05-20 23:45:39,Reddit,stocks,GOOGL,Google launches $250 per month ‘VIP’ AI subscription service,"Google is adding a new artificial intelligence subscription service that offers exclusive access to the company’s most “cutting edge” AI products.

Called “Google AI Ultra,” the new plan includes the highest usage limits and access to its latest AI models and premium features, the company announced Tuesday at its annual developer conference Google IO.

At $249.99 per month, the subscription plan also includes early access features to experimental products as well as a YouTube premium subscription.

“It’s for the trailblazers, the pioneers, those of you who want cutting-edge AI from Google,” Josh Woodward, head of product incubator Google Labs and the Gemini app, said at the event. “You can think of this Ultra plan as your VIP pass for Google AI.”

The plan offers a “massive” 30 terabytes of storage, he said.

Google charges for some premium versions of cloud services and AI products under a tier called “Google One AI Premium,” which can cost between $19.99 and $149.99 per month depending on storage size.

Google AI Ultra could attract premium users willing to pay a larger price to use Google’s products as the company tries to monetize its AI products and diversify revenue streams amid market changes.

Alphabet’s revenue growth from advertising, while still strong, has decelerated in recent years. That’s in addition to facing the growing threat of users increasingly shifting to search for information on AI chatbots created by companies like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

OpenAI last December launched ChatGPT Pro, a $200 monthly plan that allows “scaled access” to OpenAI’s best models and tools.

Google AI Ultra includes the company’s flagship AI app Gemini with the newly-announced Gemini 2.5 Pro “DeepThink” mode, which can be used for deep research, Woodward said. It will also include the new filmmaking AI tool Flow, and note-to-podcast tool Notebook LM with the highest limit.

It will continually include “a lot of other early access features,” Woodward said.

The Ultra plan also includes more experimental projects like Project Mariner, an agent research prototype that can help a user do up to 10 tasks simultaneously, as well as the latest Gemini models and early access to its Veo 3, the company’s newly announced video generation tool, the company said.

The Ultra plan will be available in the U.S. starting Tuesday, and rolling out to other countries in the coming months, the company said.

Starting Tuesday, anyone in LA will be able to use the Waymo One app to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County, the company said. That includes the 300,000 Angelenos who have been on Waymo’s waitlist.

With more than 3.8 million people, LA marks the third and largest city where the company’s robotaxi service is now fully available. It follows San Francisco, where Waymo One opened citywide in June. The company opened the service in Phoenix in 2020.

“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,” Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a news release Tuesday. “Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”

The company has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week across its three markets via the Waymo One app, the company said Tuesday. That’s up from 100,000 in August.

Waymo in September announced that it partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in 2025. The next-generation robotaxi from Waymo is a Geely Zeekr that’s equipped with custom sensors and an AI “driver.” Waymo also recently agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership with Hyundai that will add the South Korean automaker’s Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.

The Waymo One service has been embraced by some women who have safety concerns about riding with unknown human drivers. It has also been used by parents to send their teens to school.

Waymo hasn’t committed to start commercial service in Tokyo yet, but the robotaxi developer will partner with Japan’s largest taxi operator, Nihon Kotsu, and taxi app GO to start testing its Jaguar I-PACE vehicles in Tokyo’s streets.

To start, Nihon Kotsu drivers will manually operate the Waymo vehicles to map key areas of the Japanese capital, including Minato, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Chiyoda, Chūō, Shinagawa, and Kōtō. 

Data from the manned test drives will help train the company’s AI systems. Waymo will also test its robotaxis on a closed course in the U.S. built to mimic driving conditions in Japan.

This is the first phase of the partnerships, which will last several quarters, Waymo told CNBC, adding that it expects to remain in Japan for an extended period.

“Our upcoming road trip to Tokyo gives us the chance to work alongside local partners, government officials, and community groups to understand the new landscape,” Waymo said in a statement. “We’ll learn how Waymo can serve Tokyo’s residents and become a beneficial part of the city’s transportation ecosystem.”

Nihon Kotsu will oversee the management and servicing of Waymo’s vehicles in Japan, the companies said.

Waymo announced a series of expansions across the U.S. in 2024. Earlier this month, the company announced new testing in Miami in 2025, it made its driverless ride hail service available across Los Angeles in November, and in September, it announced planned expansions into Austin and Atlanta in partnership with Uber. 

The move into Japan marks the company’s first in a left-hand traffic market.

Both the Japanese national government and Tokyo Metropolitan government see driverless technology as a potential boon to the country’s aging population, according to research by the World Economic Forum.

Tokyo has designated certain areas as “test zones” for self-driving cars hoping to hasten the arrival of safe driverless transportation systems there.

Several developers are working on autonomous vehicles in Japan, including local startup Tier IV and ZMP, a robotics company that is testing delivery vehicles and buses in Tokyo. Monet Technologies, which is partly owned by Toyota, announced plans to test a self-driving taxi service in Tokyo’s Odaiba district earlier this year.

Waymo’s Japan expansion announcement comes a week after General Motors announced it was abandoning its Cruise robotaxi division. Honda, an outside investor in Cruise, told CNBC that it aimed to launch a driverless ride-hail service in Japan in early 2026 but would re-assess those plans and make adjustments if needed.

Prior to GM’s retreat from robotaxis, Cruise had been one of Waymo’s primary domestic competitors.

Shares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw a 4% increase in pre-open trading Tuesday, reflecting investor confidence following the company's unveiling of its new quantum computing chip, Willow. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, introduced the chip on Monday, highlighting its ability to significantly reduce computational errors and its performance in benchmark tests.

Pichai emphasized the chip's potential in practical applications, stating, ""We see Willow as an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications in areas like drug discovery, fusion energy, battery design + more.""

The new chip, according to Pichai, has achieved two major milestones. It can exponentially decrease errors with the addition of more qubits, addressing a quantum error correction challenge that has persisted for nearly three decades. In addition, Willow completed a standard benchmark computation in less than five minutes, a task that would take one of the fastest supercomputers today more than 10 septillion years.
This development is part of Google's long-term commitment to quantum computing, a vision that began over a decade ago when Pichai founded Google Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) AI in 2012. 

The goal is to build a quantum computer that leverages quantum mechanics to advance scientific discovery and address societal challenges.

The announcement drew a simple yet telling reaction from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who expressed his astonishment with a single word, ""wow,"" on social media platform X.

The Willow chip represents a significant advancement for Google Quantum AI and positions the company closer to achieving commercially viable quantum computing applications.",495

In a blog post Thursday, Microsoft said it’s bringing its Copilot AI assistant into the Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote applications for consumers who have the Microsoft 365 suite.

The increase of $3 per month is meant “to reflect the extensive subscription benefits that we’ve added over the past 12 years and enable us to deliver new innovations for years to come,” Bryan Rognier, vice president of Microsoft 365 Consumer, wrote in the post.

Microsoft 365 Personal will now cost $9.99 per month and $99.99 per year, up from $6.99 per month and $69.99 per year. The Microsoft 365 Family plan, which serves up to six people, will cost $12.99 per month and $129.99 per year, up from $9.99 a month and $99.99 per year.

Microsoft had 84.4 million consumer subscribers to Microsoft 365 in the September quarter, up 10%. Existing customers will see the new prices upon renewal, according to the blog post.

Formerly known as Office 365, Microsoft 365 is important to the company’s efforts to compete with Google’s productivity tools in the consumer market. But sales to businesses are far more lucrative for Microsoft.

Microsoft 365 commercial products and cloud services represented 31% of the company’s fiscal third-quarter revenue, while Microsoft 365 consumer products and cloud services contributed less than 3%. In 2022, Microsoft increased prices of commercial Microsoft 365 subscriptions for the first time.

In addition to bringing Copilot into the Microsoft 365 applications, consumer subscribers will gain access to Microsoft Designer, an AI image editing tool.

Microsoft said that, for a limited time, existing subscribers can switch to plans without Copilot or other AI.

“These plans will continue to be maintained as they exist today, but for certain new innovations and features you’ll need a Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscription,” the company said.

1gf4btm,2024-10-29 21:16:39,Reddit,stocks,GOOGL,Reddit shares soar 16% on earnings beat and better-than-expected forecast,"Reddit shares jumped 16% in extended trading on Tuesday after the social media company reported third-quarter results that topped analyst estimates and issued an optimistic forecast for the current period.

Here’s how the company did compared to LSEG estimates:

* **Earnings per share:** 16 cents vs. a loss of 7 cents
* **Revenue:** $348.4 million vs. $312.8 million expected

Reddit said fourth-quarter revenue will be between $385 million to $400 million, beating the average analyst estimate of $357.9 million. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter will be in the range of $110 million to $125 million, higher than the $85.2 million average estimate.

Revenue in the third quarter jumped 68% from a year earlier, and the company turned profitable, reporting net income of $29.9 million, compared to a net loss of $7.4 million during the same quarter a year ago.

The company said that its daily active users grew 47% year-over-year in the third quarter to 97.2 million, better than analyst estimates of 96.5 million.

Average revenue per user was $3.58 for the third quarter, which beat analyst estimates of $3.24.

“It was another strong quarter for Reddit and our communities as we achieved important milestones, including new levels of user traffic, revenue growth, and profitability,” Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said in a statement. “Reddit continues to be one of the most visited and trusted sites in the world with opportunities available to us that aren’t available to most companies.”

This is Reddit’s third earnings report since going public in March. The stock has more than doubled in value since its IPO, closing on Tuesday at $81.74, giving the company a market cap of $13.6 billion.

Since last year, Reddit has benefited from Google search updates that helped push its content higher in results, bringing in a flood of new users to the 19-year-old social media service. However, the newer users, which Reddit refers to as logged-out users, generate less online advertising revenue for the company than logged-in users, who typically spend more time on the platform, Reddit has detailed in financial filings.

The company said that global logged-out users grew 70% from a year earlier to 53.1 million, while global logged-in users increased 27% to 44.1 million.

Huffman told CNBC in August that the company has been making it easier for new users to create accounts and is developing more recommendation features to turn newbies into long-term users. He also said that Reddit’s direct traffic is “really resilient” to any Google search changes.

1j8vxgn,2025-03-11 18:12:13,Reddit,stocks,GOOGL,Trump's DOJ wants a Google breakup but is willing to leave AI alone,"President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.

But there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump’s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.

Backing off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was ""significant"" and ""very justified,"" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

It ""may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,"" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.

The stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.

The final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text.”

No matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.

Final remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.

It didn’t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.

""Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point,"" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.

It argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an “opportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google’s monopoly control.”

They also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.

But prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.

Anthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).

“Plaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google’s AI investments,” the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.

Derek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.

""They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,"" he said.

""I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.""

The tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.

""What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?” asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.

""It seems ill-timed to do that.""

The DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.

It asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox.

That is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.

Bernstein analysts have estimated Apple’s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.

Google countered the DOJ’s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default — so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.

McCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.

""Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,"" McCareins said.

The core issue OpenAI is pushing to formally transition into a for-profit entity which could potentially dilute Microsoft influence and ownership stake in the company  especially concerning any future models beyond GPT-4

Sources say that unless key terms are agreed upon Microsoft is ready to fall back on its existing commercial agreement which guarantees access to OpenAI models through 2030  unless a competitor matches or exceeds Microsoft's deal

Another twist OpenAI transition plan reportedly needs Microsoft formal approval by Dec 31, 2025. Without that green light OpenAI may risk losing interest from outside investors like SoftBank and other late-stage capital.

Despite the headlines, Microsoft commercial use case remains protected in the shorttomid term. But the question now is who controls the roadmap to GPT-5 and beyond  and whether Microsoft sees enough ROI to keep playing ball.

Alphabet’s self-driving car unit announced on Wednesday that it plans to drive vehicles manually in New York, marking the first step toward potentially cracking the largest U.S. city. Waymo said it applied for a permit with the New York City Department of Transportation to operate autonomously with a trained specialist behind the wheel in Manhattan.

“While we won’t be in New York full-time yet, we have every intention of bringing our fully autonomous ride-hailing service to the city in the future,” the company said in an announcement. “We’re working towards that goal in a few key ways.”

If the permit is granted, it would be the city’s first testing deployment of autonomous vehicles. New York state law currently prohibits a service like Waymo to operate without a driver.

“We’re advocating for a change in state law that would allow for operating a vehicle with no human behind the wheel,” the company said.

Meanwhile, Waymo is aggressively expanding into new U.S. markets. Waymo One, its ride-hailing service, provides more than 250,000 paid trips each week across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin, Texas, and is preparing to bring fully autonomous rides to Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C., in 2026.

Waymo has made a prior appearance in New York.

The company brought its cars to parts of the city in 2021 for manual driving, data collection and testing. Ethan Teicher, a Waymo spokesperson, said “it was a planned trip with a start and an end.” The testing allowed Waymo to improve driving in icy and snowy conditions in a densely populated area, the company said.

1ggtl3k,2024-11-01 01:44:41,Reddit,stocks,GOOGL,Amazon CEO pledges AI investments will pay off as capital expenditures surge 81%,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is trying to reassure investors who may be worried about the future payoff of the company’s massive investments in generative artificial intelligence.

On a conference call with analysts following the company’s third-quarter earnings report on Thursday, Jassy pointed to the success of Amazon’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, which has become a crucial profit engine despite the extreme costs associated with building data centers.

“I think we’ve proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business,” Jassy said. “We expect the same thing will happen here with generative AI.”

Amazon spent $22.6 billion on property and equipment during the quarter, up 81% from the year before. Jassy said Amazon plans to spend $75 billion on capex in 2024 and expects an even higher number in 2025.

The jump in spending is primarily being driven by generative AI investments, Jassy said. The company is rushing to invest in data centers, networking gear and hardware to meet vast demand for the technology, which has exploded in popularity since OpenAI released its ChatGPT assistant almost two years ago.

“It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity,” Jassy said. “And I think our customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long term that we’re aggressively pursuing it.”

AI spending was a big topic on tech earnings calls this week. Meta on Wednesday raised its capital expenditures guidance, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was “quite happy” with the team’s execution. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI weighed on its fiscal first-quarter earnings released on Wednesday, and the company said capital spending would continue to rise. A day earlier, Alphabet CFO Anat Ashkenazi warned the company expects capital spending to grow in 2025.

Amazon has said its cloud unit has picked up more business from companies that need infrastructure to deploy generative AI models. It’s also launched several AI products for enterprises, third-party sellers on its marketplace and advertisers in recent months. The company is expected to announce a souped-up version of its Alexa voice assistant that incorporates generative AI, something Jassy said will arrive “in the near future.”

Amazon hasn’t disclosed its revenue from generative AI, but Jassy said Thursday it’s become a “multi-billion-dollar revenue run rate” business within AWS that “continues to grow at a triple-digit year-over-year percentage.”

“It’s growing more than three times faster at this stage of its evolution as AWS itself grew, and we felt like AWS grew pretty quickly,” he added.

Amazon's advertising revenue last year was estimated at $56Bn and growing around 20% a year. This is also a high operating margin business, generating over 20% in operating profits.

While online domestic and international sales are a drag, growing slower in single digits, they're not significantly slower than Walmart’s sales growth and margins.

Amazon, Alphabet’s Google and Meta Platforms on Wednesday said they support efforts to at least triple nuclear energy worldwide by 2050.

The tech companies signed a pledge first adopted in December 2023 by more than 20 countries, including the U.S., at the U.N. Climate Change Conference. Financial institutions including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley backed the pledge last year.


The pledge is nonbinding, but highlights the growing support for expanding nuclear power among leading industries, finance and governments.

Amazon, Google and Meta are increasingly important drivers of energy demand in the U.S. as they build out artificial intelligence centers. The tech sector is turning to nuclear power after concluding that renewables alone won’t provide enough reliable power for their energy needs.

Amazon and Google announced investments last October to help launch small nuclear reactors, technology still under development that the industry hopes will reduce the cost and timelines that have plagued new reactor builds in the U.S.

Meta issued a call in December for nuclear developers to submit proposals to help the tech company add up to four gigawatts of new nuclear in the U.S.

Warby Parker shares surged 15.6% after Google announced a smart glasses partnership at the tech company’s annual I/O developer conference.

Warby Parker said it plans to launch a series of smart glasses with Google, with the first line of products set to arrive sometime “after 2025.” The glasses will be built on top of Google’s Android XR, an operating system for headset computers. Android XR will include Google’s Gemini AI assistant that users can speak with to control their device.

The Warby Parker and Google alliance will rival that of the partnership between Facebook-parent Meta and EssilorLuxottica, the maker of Ray-Ban. Meta and Luxottica in 2023 launched the second edition of their smart glasses, and the two companies are set to roll out a third generation of the glasses with a small display, CNBC previously reported. Meta first announced the partnership in 2020.

The partnership with Warby Parker is also a return to the world of glasses for Alphabet. The company famously launched its futuristic Google Glass device in 2013, but the product drew privacy concerns.

Besides Warby Parker, Google on Tuesday said it will partner with developers and device makers for Android XR, including Samsung, Qualcomm, Sony, Xreal, Magic Leap, Gentle Monster and others.",364
1lydvqt,2025-07-13 01:12:53,Reddit,stocks,GOOGL,"Google to Pay $2.4 Billion in Deal to License Tech of Coding Startup, Hire CEO","From the WSJ:

>Google has agreed to pay about $2.4 billion in a deal to license the technology of AI coding startup Windsurf and hire its CEO and some of its employees, according to people familiar with the matter.

>The deal comes after talks for OpenAI to acquire Windsurf stalled, the people said.

>The Alphabet GOOGL unit is hiring a small number of Windsurf employees to focus on agentic coding within its DeepMind division, and the tech giant will also acquire a nonexclusive license to some of Windsurf’s technology.

>Google isn’t taking a stake in Windsurf. Most of Windsurf’s existing employees will remain at the company.

>OpenAI first struck an agreement to buy the startup for $3 billion a few months ago in an effort to boost the growth of its AI coding products. But the deal hit a roadblock after Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest investor, objected to some of the terms, The Wall Street Journal reported.

>OpenAI didn’t want to give Microsoft access to Windsurf’s technology. Under their current contract, the tech giant is entitled to all of the startup’s intellectual property.

>The failed talks are a setback for OpenAI, which is racing against other tech companies to build AI coding assistants, one of the largest new markets enabled by generative AI, and shows how tensions with its largest partner are hampering major business efforts. It is also another example of the pitched battle going on between Silicon Valley giants to hire and retain the most talented AI scientists and engineers.

>Tech giants have pursued similar “acquihire” deals as a way to attract top startup talent while avoiding the scrutiny of antitrust regulators. Google last year paid $2.7 billion to hire its former researcher, Noam Shazeer, and license technology from the startup he started, Character.AI. Microsoft and Amazon have also struck similar deals with startups.

>Google negotiated its deal with Windsurf after the exclusivity window for talks between OpenAI and Microsoft fell through. Tech news site The Verge earlier reported on some aspects of Google’s deal.

1ji0s61,2025-03-23 15:41:31,Reddit,investing,GOOGL,Why is S&P 500 investing the default when the Nasdaq Composite has performed better over every 30 year window?,"A little Google Finance magic and you can create some plots showing you the ""multiples"" of your money had it been invested for X number of years (I prefer this over unwieldy percentages).

If you invested your money into one index for 30 years that first dollar will have grown by the multiple below. I show two periods the last 30 years, and the 30 years before that:

Period #1 (1995-2025): S&P 500 - 7.6x | Dow Jones - 10.1x | **Nasdaq - 21.7x** ([plot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRgRe1DDKrRvQFzPZaBTs4kUKH2D1k8EPflAY7JsAcBi2635-891Q3PSTL_eMIaVXK-CMGH2c6TP2tw/pubchart?oid=97885568&format=interactive))

Period #2 (1965-1995): S&P - 5.7x | Dow Jones - 4.6x | **Nasdaq - 8.1x** (plot: [plot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRgRe1DDKrRvQFzPZaBTs4kUKH2D1k8EPflAY7JsAcBi2635-891Q3PSTL_eMIaVXK-CMGH2c6TP2tw/pubchart?oid=1857506659&format=interactive))

Nasdaq does better. Why are we generally piling into VOO or SPY instead of QQQ or ONEQ?

(I also understand that it doesn't make sense to factor invest into a market exchange, of all things, but what about it makes it more performant over our one true love S&P 500?)



\----  
Edit #1: The astute have pointed out, I cherry picked 2 periods. I ran the rolling/slider analysis and plotted here: [plot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRgRe1DDKrRvQFzPZaBTs4kUKH2D1k8EPflAY7JsAcBi2635-891Q3PSTL_eMIaVXK-CMGH2c6TP2tw/pubchart?oid=467475738&format=interactive).

It's a little confusing because all the data is being transformed on itself (and rolled into a single number), but here's the interpretation: X-axis represents your ""present day"" and you started investing 30yrs prior to that. Your gains (as a multiple) are shown on the Y-axis above. The chart as a whole represents 60yrs of investing.

\- The Nasdaq wins out fairly significantly, 20x on average, to S&P's \~7x.

\- The Dow and S&P are much older so the data's valid through all the dates we're looking at; the Nasdaq needed to be clipped at 2001 (opened in 1971).

\- Dividends are not included, but someone let me know how to estimate adding 3% (vs 1%) dividends to the total returns and compare that to 20x vs 7x multiples. Instinct says it doesn't catch up, but math is funny like that.",468
1o06of3,2025-10-07 07:55:06,Reddit,investing,GOOGL,Patent analysis reveals where smart money is actually betting on AI,"Went through this analysis of 2,398 generative AI patents filed globally from 2017 to 2023 breaks down into 6 categories. The biggest category was financial and information security applications at 22.8% of all patents. Image generation and processing comes second at 21.7% and medical applications comes after at 14.6%.

Conversational AI,  the chatbot offered by OpenAI/Antrhopic/Meta/Google etc actually came at fourth place.

Object detection, crucial for autonomous vehicles and robotics, is declining in patent activity (Not sure if tech has matured, or they can't see the ROI anymore). So is financial security despite being the largest category. Image generation peaked around 2021 and dipped after 2022.

On the other hand, medical applications and cyber physical systems are growing fast. 

What I want to say here is that if you're long on AI, the patent trends suggest medical and cyber physical applications have more room to run. The financial security space might be mature or hitting diminishing returns. Image generation looks like it's consolidating.

One last thing, the analysis found all correlations between application categories were negative. What this means is that innovation is siloed and not interrelated. In simpler terms, a breakthrough in medical imaging doesn't transfer to financial fraud detection even though both use similar neural network architectures. So GenAI isn't one market, it's 6 separate markets that happen to use related technology.

If you're investing in AI through geographic ETFs or regional indexes, this ranking tells you where actual innovation is concentrated versus where the headlines come from. Not investment advice obviously, but patent trend analysis is one of those alternative data sources that might give you an edge before quarterly reports catch up.

I searched google and had a long conversation with ChatGPT that went nowhere. I now understand P/E ratios when it comes to ""*A P/E of 670 means you pay $670 for every $1 the company earns annually""* because I heard a great vending machine analogy and I read a comparison about Microsoft.

(**Machine** **costs $2,000 up front. makes $200 a year; P/E = 10x**).

What I **don't** understand is the notion that it would take **ME,** the **STOCK INVESTOR**, that much time.

I feel blindsighted by the fact that the only money I will ever see is from when the value of the stock goes up.

The ""670 years"" thing to me makes no sense. Not that it makes no sense, as in I understand where it's coming from, but it's just untrue to me. It makes no sense **simply because I don't get it**, and can't find any resources that know what I mean when posing my question.

The root of my problem may be my ability to explain my confusion, but I tried to do my best to put it all together here, and the clarity seems perfect to me. Maybe the issue is everyone takes this phrase a face value and doesn't think about its meaning?... Idk.

The vending machine analogy was a great way for me to understand it when it comes to someone who actually gets the profit, but I'm completely failing to comprehend its connection to investing.

1nrrne6,2025-09-27 12:17:01,Reddit,investing,GOOGL,Is Google still cheap? 10 year expected returns,"Google went from “Search is dead” to “Google might be the most valuable company because of AI,” fueling a 70% rally in just half a year. Congrats to those who realized that search wasn’t dead and captured those fast gains. To me, this wasn’t a difficult call, quarter after quarter, it was clear that search was performing better and better.

However, is GOOGL still a bargain after a 70% rally? Lets look into it.

When I evaluate whether a stock is a bargain, I typically use discounted models for Free Cash Flow (FCF), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and revenue. I base these models on conservative growth rates and terminal valuations, which give me both an expected-case and worst-case fair value.  
After making the model, I can adjust the expected CAGR return, to determine the expected returns to justify the current market cap. So I will provide what we can expect Google stock will return every year (on average) the next 10 years.

From there, I look for at least a 12.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next 10 years. That may sound aggressive, but it builds in a margin of safety while ensuring my returns are likely to outperform the S&P 500.

Once the model is built, I adjust the expected CAGR to see what kind of return the current market cap implies together with the expected growth rates and terminal valuations.

Anyways here are the results:

FCF: 6% to 7.5% CAGR  
EPS: 11.5% to 14.5% CAGR  
Revenue: 5% to 7% CAGR

So is GOOGL a bargain at today's price?  
Probably not.

Expecting annual returns of around 7%, or as low as 5% under worse assumptions, is not particularly exciting. Note that EPS return estimates are likely inflated due to share buy backs.

That said, this is not a case for selling. GOOGL remains my largest position. Google is one of the greatest businesses in the world, and apart from Saudi Aramco (big oil), it is the highest-earning company globally, while Google's margins and growth are outstanding.

Holding onto world-class businesses, even when they are trading at okay rather than great prices, is perfectly fine. But I will not be adding to my position at current levels.

For me this is a clear hold.",277

I say this having read about people cancelling subscriptions to US companies in protest of the apparent complicity of US companies with an administration allegedly now aligned with (or perhaps even in cahoots) with Putin. I also am starting to feel unsure about US companies holding personal data that may no longer be secure given their apparent desire to kowtow to the White House.

With all this is mind I expect to see a slow down in revenue from major US consumer focused corporations (such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, META etc) in the next reporting quarter a few months away.

The finance committee just voted 14-13 to have Robert Kennedy Jr proceed to a senate floor vote. It's likely the case that he's going to be made secretary of HHS.

Part of the changes that are about to be made is related to food dyes and food additives.

He's posted many such videos on YouTube outlining how the US has more of these additives than Europeans allow in their foods.

Food dyes like Red 40 are linked to many health ailments.

# I looked into some companies that deal with food dyes and came upon 3.

1. Dupont de Nemours (DD) - 32.15B market cap
2. Sensient Technologies Corporation (SXT) - 3.2B market cap
3. Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) - 22.95B market cap

There may be more out there so definitely go looking into it as you might some profitable opportunities.

# 1) Dupont de Nemours

I'll keep this one short. Dupont has a cool ticker but they are gigantic and don't disclose how many of their sales come from food dyes. They also have their hands in other ventures so I skipped out on it but maybe some other people can dig into whether its a good opportunity.

# 2) Sensient Technologies

I was excited about this one when I first found it. Their revenues for their Flavors & Extracts group had a revenue of $203 million in Q3 and their Color group had $162 million in Q3.

Sadly, there are no juicy options on this for puts. That made me sad. Something to monitor though as this industry receives more attention.

# 3) Archer Daniels Midland

I'll start off by saying that I'm super bummed out about this one. I found them the day of their earnings reports and saw they're down 4%. I wish I found this one yesterday.

I first looked through their returns over the years and they're down 31.50% over the last 3 years. Sentiment among shareholders is low from browsing through various forums.

The company reports that their losses were as a result of a drop in seed oil demand.

I don't know if you've been on YouTube lately, but a lot of channels are discussing the cons of seed oils. I'm not here to turn this into a debate. This is about money. Their seed oil division has plunged 32% year over year.

Go on Google Trends and type in beef tallow and you'll see how much its gaining in popularity:

[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=beef%20tallow&hl=en](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=beef%20tallow&hl=en)

Guess who's against seed oils and is a supporter of beef tallow? Possibly the next HHS secretary if he gets confirmed.

Keep in mind, it's extremely rare for a cabinet pick not to get approved by the Senate. There have been only 6 such cases in the past 100 years.

The company is going to close down some of their seed oil ventures. Some people might see that as a positive reason to buy so there's risk there involved with buying puts.

In 2014, ADM purchased WILD Flavors and food dyes account for 9% of their business.

If people are buying less seed oils and if more food dyes become banned (as Red 3 was during the previous administration), then this could hurt ADM.

This is just preliminary research but things are moving fast politically and its in these moments where profits are being made.

Just after his finance committee vote cleared, vaccine stocks dropped.

I'm not saying to buy puts, do your own due diligence. But there's an opportunity here. It's not as popular of a stock as the other healthcare stocks that are being sold today.

If you have any other companies that are in the food dye niche, please post them below so that I can look into them. Would like to have as many as possible.",226

My base salary is $75,000 and the rest is bonus based off of 10% of cash flow I bring in.  In 2023 I made $122,000 and 2022 only 86,000.

If this is the case, what are my options... Googling it, I'm seeing if you make over $155,000 you cant do IRAs either... Just back door IRAs?...

Thanks for any input or help.  Although retirement is far away this is stressing me out.",216

It was down 8% and has a P/E of 16.9. 16.9?! For GOOGL? I understand that the DOJ is looking at its partnership with AAPL and apps like ChatGPT are taking market share, but GOOGL has YouTube, WayMo, and so many other high growth businesses. Also a small dividend. I personally prefer searching on Google than ChatGPT. 

Full disclosure: I bought some shares at $149. Already owned at a cost basis of around $85.

Amazon at 33 is one of its lowest P/E levels ever, and even if tariffs slow spending, they're the lowest cost option for most people shopping online.

Alphabet's search downfall feels overhyped in a year of nerves.  They've got lots of other businesses, Gemini could be great for them, they're well managed.  P/E, 18.

Apple has seen a similar price dip, but.... At 32 its P/E is nowhere near cheap historically.  I don't know what I think about it.

1h0050p,2024-11-26 02:38:44,Reddit,investing,GOOGL,Most big airline stocks are up by 33-166% since August. Any ideas why?,"I recently noticed that United Airlines went through the roof in the last few months, so I looked at a bunch of other airlines and found that most of them are doing really well since the first week of August. Most of them were going downhill until then, but then they collectively went up really fast, even though at the same time we saw the largest plunge in the stock market in two years. Why is that?  
  
Some examples from August until today:  
US:  
United: 34,61 to 92,40€ (+166%)  
Delta: 32,45 to 62,44€ (+92%)  
American: 8,37 to 14,22€ (+69%)  
Southwest: 21,91 to 31,19€ (+42%)  
Also Jetblue and Skywest.
  
International:  
IAG (British Airways and Iberia) 1,65 to 3,06€ (+85%)  
Quantas 3,42 to 5,45 (+59%)  
RyanAir 13,60 to 18,59€ (+36%)  
EasyJet  4,80 to 6,40 (+33%)
  
Of course I have googled this, but couldn't find a good answer. A Forbes article believes that it's because of lower fuel prices, but is that enough for those massive gains? And why are there some major airlines that aren't doing well at all, like Lufthansa, KLM (Air France) and of course Spirit? Fuel Prices should help all of them equally.  
I also read, that it's because of Trump's re-election, because he wants to loosen regulations. But that wasn't in August, so that doesn't make much sense either.

Google’s still the king of search, but between antitrust pressure and the AI arms race, I wanted to sanity-check the numbers. I grabbed their latest filings and ran a DCF just to see if the current price makes sense.

Revenue went from \~$182B five years ago to \~$371B now, gross profit up 123% to $218B. EBIT nearly tripled to $140B. Net income’s at $115B vs $40B, and EPS is 9.37 TTM. Margins actually improved: gross 59%, operating 33%, net 31%. Pretty wild at that scale.

Balance sheet looks fine. Cash + ST investments \~$21B, total assets $502B. Debt climbed (long-term $23B, total $41B), but net debt is –$53B so they’re still sitting on a big cushion. Shares outstanding down 11% from buybacks, retained earnings up to $275B.

Cash flow doubled: operating cash $133B vs $65B. Heavy CapEx, likely data centers. Current ratio dropped from 3 to 1.9, liquidity a bit tighter, but ROA 23%, ROCE 34%. Debt/assets low at 0.28, interest coverage \~348. Dividend yield basically 0, but technically there.

Valuation stuff: P/S 6.9, PEG 1.67, beta \~1. Ran an advanced DCF (10y projection, 2.5% terminal growth, 8.3% WACC). Fair value came out \~$207/share. Current price \~$211 → basically in line, around –1.9% downside. Feels like the market’s got it about right.

1ladgw1,2025-06-13 13:25:40,Reddit,investing,GOOGL,S&P 500 premium is mostly warranted says BofA,"Bank of America analysts argued in a note Friday that the S&P 500’s valuation premium is “mostly warranted,” despite the index appearing expensive by traditional measures.

“The S&P 500 now trades at 21x forward earnings, 35% above average,” BofA wrote, adding that it “looks statistically expensive relative to its own history on all 20 of the valuation metrics we track.”

However, the analysts say comparisons to historical averages may be misleading.

“Today’s S&P is apples vs. prior decades’ oranges,” they said, noting a shift in sector composition.

“Nearly 70% of the index was asset-intensive Manufacturing sectors in 1980 vs. <20% today.”

They argue the index “has become higher quality, with lower leverage, lower earnings volatility, and higher margins.”

BofA also defended the U.S. market’s premium over global peers. “The US trades as the most expensive region (\~40% premium vs. Europe/Asia which trade at 16x),” they noted, but emphasized that “quality, balance sheets, growth potential and risk are statistically superior.”

They pointed to the U.S. being “half as levered as other regions” and praised “significantly lower estimate dispersion on 2025/2026 forecasts.”

Additionally, the U.S. offers “roughly double the long-term growth potential of Asia and Europe, with lower earnings volatility than Europe, plus higher free cash flow per share and a lower percentage of non-earners vs. both Asia and Europe,” says the bank.

BofA also cited structural advantages including “labor fungibility, USD as reserve currency, energy independence, unparalleled liquidity and Tech primacy (at least for now).”

GOOGL, MSFT, NEE, META, BGM, and FCX may benefit from the S&P 500’s sector shift toward higher-quality, capital-light companies, especially in tech, renewables, and metals.

For near-term positioning, BofA’s tactical model prefers U.S. “Communication Services, Utilities and Tech,” and highlights “Interactive Media & Services, Metals & Mining and Independent Power & Renewable Electricity Producers” as top industry opportunities.",144

1iouthx,2025-02-13 23:00:42,Reddit,investing,GOOGL,ACHR is a $4.4B market cap company that doesn't sell anything.... Yet,"I want to share a new stock I have recently become obsessed with and that is Archer Aviation. They are creating eVTOL air taxi's for commercial and defense projects. The official drop of their flagship Midnight is as early as Q4'25.

**For my TL/DR folks:** ACHR go BRRR

So what makes this company so special? Why is the market cap \~$4B considering it's P/E ratio is -7.02 and why is the company spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year, while generating $0 in revenue? The short answer is they are building really cool shit, have $6B+ in pre-orders and were just given $301.75M by BlackRock to expand its defense market. Giving the company a liquidity of \~$1B to spend.

Archer is creating piloted air taxis that will work similar jobs as helicopters, the kicker is these planes are electric so they don't make a bunch of noise, and you don't need to maintain a traditional combustion engine which cuts down on maintenance costs. The goal is to have them autonomous in the future, and their whole website is filled with the eco-friendly terminology that a lot of people will get off to. Not sure how eco-friendly deleting terrorist with a silent helicopter is, but who cares. What I care about is: do they have great leadership, a great product, and is the stock under valued.

Lets take a deeper look at **Archers leadership:**

CEO - Adam Goldstein  
CTO - Tom Muniz  
CFO - Mark Mesler  
CE - Dr. Geoff Bower  
CPPO - Tosha Perkins  
GC - Eric Lentell

There is nothing really notable about this crowd of people, they either worked for niche companies, sold their companies for $100M, or worked at big accounting firms that no one gives a shit about. I initially saw this and didn't care about this company myself. However I am a huge fan of Anduril and I was curious how Archer is getting partnerships with leading defense contractors, airlines, automotive companies, etc.

The news wasn't adding up to the experience of the leadership team, so I did more digging and low and behold I stumbled across **their Board of Directors:**

**Deborah Diaz** \- Former CIO and Deputy CIO of NASA, helped stand up the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and formerly was on the board for a few small companies like: Dell Technologies and Forcepoint.

**Fred Diaz** \- Former CEO of Mitsubishi Americas, General Manager Mitsubishi in Japan, VP & GM Nissan, with additional roles at Fiat-Chrysler, Ram Truck Brand, Chrysler Mexico, and so on.

**Oscar Munoz** \- Former CEO of United Airlines, with executive leadership at Continental Airlines, Pepsi Co, Coca Cola, AT&T, and Univision Communications.

**Barbara Pilarski** \- Current Global Head for Stellantis N. V. (Fiat & Chrysler)

**Maria Pinelli and Michael Spellacy** \- Both CPA Wizards working across the America's and worked for large accounting firms like EY, Accenture, etc.

So I see this shit, and it all starts to make sense, you have an executive leadership team that fully understand financing & engineering, backed by a board that understand everything about manufacturing, government process, airline industry, and everything in between.

Now I am thinking this company is too good to be true, what else could they possibly be up to, well the answer is they brought in 12 military consultants, 10 of which are former 2-4 star generals and the other 2 were contracting experts with one specializing in Special Operations Command (SOCOM). These consultants will be driving the discussion on how best to create air taxis for military applications. The partnership with Anduril shines here, because Anduril is the current golden child of government contracting and if they ever went public I would leverage every penny I have on them. A quick google search will show you all the contracts they are winning.

So does it make sense to enter into this stock knowing there is immense risk that this could be a colossal failure. Well I do believe that city congestion is starting to become a big concern, and trains and cars do slow down the process. Does it make sense to use a eVTOL for this type of travel? In my opinion yes, it's a theoretically better helicopter that is quieter and that's a great use case for intra-city travel. Not to mention it's military use cases are limitless for special operations.

Analysts are viewing this company as a strong buy with an average price target of $11.25. GAAP operating expenses for Q4 2024 will range between $120 million and $140 million, with non-GAAP operating expenses aligning with the guidance range of $95 million to $110 million. Total assets according to their quarterly report is $651.5M with $183.8M in total liabilities. Based on the free cash they have now, they have about 2-3 years of runway (thanks for the correction u/[Valuable-Ingenuity99](https://www.reddit.com/user/Valuable-Ingenuity99/)) if they maintain the same spending habits before they implode and I write the losses off in my taxes.

Their **Q4'24 financial results call is scheduled for Feb 27, 2025** and I have purchased **1,600 shares at a fill price of $9.40**. Due to the nature of the company, use cases for both commercial and military applications, the board leading them, and the partnerships/companies they have secured. I believe that this is a company that can realistically pop off, if the Q4'25 launch is a hit. I have an additional $12k that I will be averaging down with, but this is a stock that I feel confidently has the ability to get into the $15+ range, post launch (assuming it's a success).

**Insider Trading Habits:**

Stellantis owns \~59,734,962 shares of ACHR, and has been buying loads of shares since March of 2024. Tom Muniz, Michael Spellacy, both sold around 550k shares near Christmas 2024, with one transaction on 1/7/25. This doesn't alarm me since they are still sitting on over 1m shares each still, and they were likely just buying Christmas presents or selling to pay off their taxes. Brett Adcock isn't listed anywhere on the website, but has Founder as his status for Archer on LinkedIn, looks like hes a degenerate gambler since he has 9 options sales executed within June and July of 2023 alone (one of us). Hes coping by making AI robots in Palo Alto now (golf clap).

For all the reasons outlined in this post I believe this is a moderate to high risk play that can yield some disgustingly high returns should the company perform the way they intend to. This is not a short term play, I intend to hold this for a while. I personally like the stock, and if you feel the same I hope you do your own research before making a conclusion.

But who knows, maybe I'm just regarded.",91

Bryce C. Tingle, business law prof at U. of Calgary, writes;

> Over the past 30 years, the number of companies that sell shares on markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq has fallen by roughly 50 percent.  ... I have spent more than a decade trying to understand what is going on, and I have come to believe that the culprit is public company governance, the system in which many different groups, all pursuing their own agendas, generate rules for how public companies ought to be managed. These rules, norms and regulations — which tackle such issues as who gets to be a director, how executives should be paid, in what ways companies ought to respond to climate change — are constantly accruing and building on one another until this obscure process generates towering structures that, like a great coral reef, can tear out the bottom of a boat. 

> From 2000 to 2020, only about 10 percent of a thousand successful venture-capital-backed companies chose to go public.

Does this mean that regular investors are fighting for the scraps, leading to a bubble in the highly valued tech stocks that are publicly traded?

Google AI tells me that US private companies are worth $14T, vs $63T public market cap.  But if this $14T is concentrated in novel tech, it's significant.  On the other hand,  most private cap companies are small.  On the third hand, it's likely comparatively little value resides in the long tail of small companies, just like the SP500.   For example, Anthropic is estimated to be worth $180B, and that's from a funding round, which I would think prices it conservatively.


Counterargument: if there's a bubble in AI and other tech, and you have a successful private company, it makes sense to go public and exploit that bubble by selling shares to a starving market.  Then again, it might make more sense to sell it when it's bigger, so the little guys don't get the benefit of the first phases of expansion.",80

S&P is great, and by being 50+% VOO and a mix of mag 7, I’ve had excellent returns since 2020. With that said, I’m a young investor (27m), and I’d like to plan more intelligently for the long term. 

What industries, or companies, do you all believe will be around and thriving 20-30+ years from now?

For me, I think the culture of “tech” companies will continue to be strong with their hyper efficiency, monopolistic power, and acquisitive nature. So amazon, google, meta and Microsoft, will continue to acquire competitors and dominate all aspects of American life for years to come imo, but there are also dominant monopoly-like players in Walmart and Costco which I also believe will continue to rise and do in the physical world what the tech giants can’t/won’t. In terms of “what we’ll always need” in food, water, shelter, I’m less familiar with players that have the same level of dominance and will last. 

I think energy is the crisis of our time, but I’m hesitant to bet on any individual company at this point. I’m not sure if others have insight, but I’d love to hear arguments not for what matters this year, but what will matter in the longest term.

Thanks in advance for any contributions.

1mscnob,2025-08-17 02:25:26,Reddit,investing,GOOGL,Help me to understand the differences between GOOG and GOOGL & Starmine Analyst ratings.,"My inderstanding is that GOOGL is the original full voting rights google shares, and GOOG are pretty much exactly the same thing but without voting rights.  Every explanationI've read on this tells me that for this reason GOOGL should be slightly more expensive that GOOG.   As a small investor voting rights are pretty much irrelevant to me.

Yet at Fridays close, GOOGL closed at 203.90 and GOOG at 204.91.   Ok, thats not a huge difference, but it's in the opposite direction I would expect.

Then looking at Starmine analyst ratings I see that GOOGL is rated 8.2 - Bullish, yet GOOG is 6.9 -Neutral.  Should not both stocks have pretty much the same rating?",52

I've deleted cookies. I've used different browsers and even different computers.

Interestingly, there are no issues at all on my phone. It's just a desktop issue.

That being said, I like to keep a tab open on my work laptop to keep an eye on things throughout the day. Given that it's been over a week, I'm not sure if/when Yahoo will fix this, so I'll ask for recommendations from you guys...what do you guys use to track your investments?

1hd0gbz,2024-12-13 02:01:19,Reddit,investing,GOOGL,"Annual year-end explanation for large, unexpected drops in your fund","Please read before posting.

A fund is pooled investment vehicle with a basket of individual stocks/bonds/whatever. Many such funds are structured as RICs or regulated investment companies.

Within the fund, the fund managers are constantly selling/buying and receiving dividends.

The IRS has special rules for RICs which allow them to not pay taxes on the capital gains/dividends generated provided they pass through almost all of the proceeds from said activities to the shareholder within the calendar year. So, dividends are often paid on some set schedule but capital gains are generally retained within the fund till the end of the year (because losses can reduce gains but can't be distributed to a shareholder).

So on to why your fund dropped: in mid-December everyone starts distributing these gains and as we know when a fund makes a distribution its NAV drops by an equal amount. For example - a fund that was trading at $10 and had It's value made up of $9 worth of stock and $1 worth of cash to be distributed now no longer has that $1. So it'll drop by 10% because of that fact. Don't worry, you didn't lose any money because the $1 was paid to you in cash (and in most cases reinvested in the form of buying more shares).

There isn't any value created or lost in a distribution (except to taxes) it's just a necessary taxable transaction that must occur because of how mutual funds are structured. ETFs are technically subject to this as well but since most follow passive cap weighted strategies or use the creation/redemption to wash out appreciated shares so they don't usually have capital gains realized to distribute.

Also please feel free to add whatever questions/comments you have to this sticky.

Here's a quick way to see what capital gains estimates/distribution dates are for most funds: [https://mutualfundobserver.com/discuss/discussion/56970/2020-capital-gains-estimates](https://mutualfundobserver.com/discuss/discussion/56970/2020-capital-gains-estimates).

The House Rules Committee scheduled an unusual 1 a.m. ET hearing that is expected to run well into daylight hours as Republicans try to overcome internal divisions about cuts to the Medicaid health program and tax breaks in high-cost coastal states.

U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged, however, that a vote by the full chamber might not happen on Wednesday.

Nonpartisan analysts said the proposed plan could add between $3 trillion and $5 trillion to the federal government's $36.2 trillion debt.

""This tax bill could be a coin toss in its current form; it could go either way,"" said Mariam Adams, managing director at UBS Wealth Management.
""It really depends on how much relief the average investor... (is) receiving. If it can impact and give some kind of faith to individual investors, that could give us a really good rally.""

At 11:53 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 332.05 points, or 0.78%, to 42,345.19, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 10.06 points, or 0.17%, to 5,930.40, and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) gained 70.80 points, or 0.36%, to 19,213.51.
Boosting the Nasdaq, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) jumped 4.9%, while Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) climbed close to 1% each.
Nine of the 11 S&P sub-sectors traded lower, with Health Care (.SPXHC) being the worst hit.

U.S. bonds have been pressured since the start of the week, when Moody's downgraded the country's sovereign credit rating. Yields on the 30-year note were back up to 5.01% on Wednesday, with the benchmark 10-year yield climbing 5.2 basis points to 4.53%.

UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N) dropped 4.5% after a Guardian report said the healthcare conglomerate secretly paid nursing homes thousands in bonuses to help reduce hospital transfers for ailing residents. HSBC also downgraded the stock to ""reduce"" from ""hold"".

In earnings, retailer Target (TGT.N) fell 3.5% after slashing its annual forecast due to a pullback in discretionary spending.
Wolfspeed (WOLF.N) tumbled nearly 70% following a report that the semiconductor supplier was preparing to file for bankruptcy within weeks.

Despite the losses, U.S. stocks have had a solid month so far. The S&P 500 has climbed more than 17% from its April lows, when Trump's reciprocal tariffs roiled global markets.

A pause in the tariffs, a temporary U.S.-China trade truce and tame inflation data have pushed equities higher, although the S&P 500 is still about 3% off its record highs.

Brokerage Morgan Stanley upgraded its stance on U.S. equities to ""overweight"", saying the global economy was still expanding, albeit slowly, amid policy uncertainty.

Meanwhile, bitcoin scaled a fresh all-time high of $109,481.83. Exchange operator Coinbase (COIN.O) gained 2.1% and crypto miners including Riot Platforms (RIOT.O) rose about 3%.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.76-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.02-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

This isn’t a one-off equity play but a strategic bet on owning more of the hardware pipeline for AI-powered eyewear rather than relying on third-party manufacturers [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zuckerbergs-meta-reportedly-takes-stake-in-ray-ban-maker-showing-commitment-to-ai-powered-smartglasses-4d4e812d?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

By embedding itself in the world’s biggest eyewear company, Meta is aiming to accelerate development of smartglasses that can livestream, translate languages on the fly, and serve as lightweight AR companions instead of bulky VR headsets. Reality Labs has burned through tens of billions in losses chasing the Metaverse dream, but smartglasses have sold more than two million units and promise to bridge the gap to mainstream adoption.

The immediate market reaction was a five-percent pop in EssilorLuxottica’s share price, reflecting investor belief that Meta’s backing will speed production capacity from two million to ten million pairs by 2026. Competitors from Google to Xiaomi are racing to enter the AI wearables fray, but Meta’s equity cushion and deep pockets give it a home-court advantage in shaping design, distribution and software integration.

For end users and developers alike this signals a coming wave of smarter, sleeker eyewear packed with AI features that could redefine how we capture memories, navigate cities or even interact with the digital world. By putting real dollars behind high-fashion names like Prada and Oakley as well as Ray-Ban, Meta is signaling that the next revolution in personal tech won’t be on your wrist or in your pocket but right in front of your eyes.

**1. Every** segment of [Google's business is growing](https://app.mecompounding.com/tickers/GOOGL/financials) and creating an overall revenue growth rate 12-15% Y/Y.  
2. The financial foundation is really strong. The long term debt is 3 times lower than yearly free cash flow, assets is 4 times bigger than liabilities, the margins are improving almost quarterly.  
3. Everyone is running is screaming that Google Search is dead and ChatGPT would kill it, but the search revenue has grown 26% since the launch of ChatGPT in November of 2022. Moreover, Google's Gemeni is really, really strong. I use it for work and analysis.  
4. DOJ scrutiny? Yes, it hearts, but Google will service and went out stronger (look how Microsoft, Visa and other giants can live with it for years). Moreover new Google investments will surpass the damage.  
5. When I look on new Google's investments and tragectory, I think they are safe for now. The fastest growing cloud, Waymo is getting new licenses, best AI in class, improvements in search.

The company that is growing revenue, earnings, rewarding investors with buybacks and dividends are trading at 19P/E.   
This is the multiple of [NKE](https://app.mecompounding.com/tickers/NKE/summary) and [PEP](https://app.mecompounding.com/tickers/PEP/summary). Let me remind you that NKE has decreasing margins, decreasing market share, EPS and revenue are falling for 2 years almost every quarter, and still the valuation is 19P/E. PEP is lowering their forecast and has almost no growth neither in revenue nor EPS. Additionally, they have significant dividend burden. And still 20P/E.

I just don't think that GOOGL really deserves such treatment. The company is really strong and is doing great strategic investments. I think right now might be a good time to add some GOOGL shares to your portfolio. WDYT?",33

Back in 2019, we demonstrated that a quantum computer could solve a problem that would take the fastest classical supercomputer thousands of years. Then, late last year (2024), our new Willow quantum chip showed how to dramatically suppress errors, solving a major issue that challenged scientists for nearly 30 years. Today’s breakthrough moves us much closer to quantum computers that can drive major discoveries in areas like medicine and materials science.

\- 1% Expense Ratio.  
\- Nearly half of the fund is just a collection of other ETFs.  
\- It is owned and managed by the same wealth management company.  
\- The expense ratio is buried way at the bottom of the fund’s site, and holdings are listed alphabetically (so it’s easy to miss that most of the fund is just other ETFs).

1nmnmh3,2025-09-21 11:34:11,Reddit,investing,GOOGL,"Late cycle consumer spending shift = downside CMG, SG, etc?","
TL;DR: bearish Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen. Looking for suggestions on similar situations. The devaluation of fast casuals, lululemon feels like a symptom of shifting culture and consumer behaviour. Inflation, portion size shrinking, declining economic activity, consumer fatigue, non existent brand loyalty, and limited scope to rebrand, reinvent, optimize. Late-cycle cultural and consumer-spending shift, where former aspirational brands (fast casual, athleisure, boutique fitness, “accessible luxury”) have gone from status signifiers to punchlines.

Six years ago I visited a Lululemon store for the first time having been familiar with the brand for many years. I knew the brand as a high quality expensive semi boutique level product associated with Soul Cycle, Equinox etc. The store gave a different impression. Some of the clothes were wrinkled and badly presented, customer service was non existent, and they seemed to have no inventory. I assumed it was a one off bad example. But over the following six years I saw the same symptoms again and again and again. Meanwhile, other clues appeared: bigger and bigger sales discounts; diversification into non-sports products with no cohesive direction; a noticeable drop in quality of some garments (I’ve received a few Lululemon gifts down the years). Competitors with cheaper, equally good quality gear eating their market share. 


When I read about $LULU’s demise, I thought “oh course!” (hindsight’s easy, huh?) and began thinking who’s next? While already down bad this year, I can’t help shake the feeling Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen have much more downside risk. The traction gained by the “slop bowl” meme to describe their offerings feels like the Chipotle’s Mr Big dying on a Peloton bike moment. An increasing number of comedians joke about slop bowls and the term “slop bowl” has spiked to four times its previous highs on Google search trends this week. It sounds trivial, but this pervasive content influences our tastes, prompts us to take a look in the mirror at stuff we do on autopilot. I think small rallies / dead cat bounce short covering strength just offer nice entry position opportunities to get short.

With inflation rising sharply, portion sizes shrinking, declining quality of ingredients being masked with higher and higher salt content, these brands need to reinvent in other directions. Trouble is, I don’t know where they can turn. I don’t trust they do either. 

The 2010-19 period brought Netflix, Spotify, fast casual lunch spots with “healthy options” and “fresh ingredients”, it brought Equinox and Soul Cycle and F45 and Amex Platinum lounges to create the illusion for aspirational young professionals that they’ve made it to the top. That illusion is being dismantled. Costs are spiralling, fees are rising, and all these brands and business models feel tired and dare I say a bit embarrassing? These brands were once exciting and pleasing. Aspirational. Now, they feel tired and clichéd. Their complacency isn’t deserving of our money and I think they are heavily exposed to a new wave of disruptors over the coming years.

The 2010-19 era saw consumer spending shift away from luxury goods, cars, Electronics and refocus on travel, food, lifestyle. With more Americans owning passports than ever before and travelling to Europe in record numbers, it might sound silly to claim we’re at a turning point from experience-centric consumer spending, but I truly think we’ve reached saturation point in this cultural cycle. I suspect we’re seeing the beginning of the end of this cycle with no clear path to what the next looks like. 

One thing’s for sure: queueing up every day to buy $20 cardboard bowl of rice, cheese, soggy chicken, greens, some kind of flavored salty liquid labelled as dressing is an undignified experience we will come to laugh at in years to come.",20

1hzxaak,2025-01-12 22:19:37,Reddit,investing,GOOGL,SoundHound: AI Hype Can’t Mask Weak Fundamentals,"**Summary:**

* SoundHound's stock price has surged due to the Amelia acquisition, but organic growth remains weak, and losses are substantial.
* The company operates in highly fragmented markets with growing competition, making substantial profits unlikely.
* The current extreme valuation seems unsustainable given poor fundamentals, though AI hype and growth via acquisitions may delay a correction.

SoundHound’s (NASDAQ: SOUN) stock has seen a dramatic pullback recently after an earlier surge driven by the acquisition of Amelia. While the acquisition has bolstered headline growth figures, SoundHound continues to face challenges in generating organic growth, and its financial losses remain significant. The company’s previous acquisitions have drawn attention to its underlying weaknesses, with critics pointing out that inorganic growth has been used to offset disappointing performance in core operations. Although the stock price has risen by over 200% since earlier criticism, the fundamentals offer little support for its current valuation.

Market enthusiasm for AI and speculative growth potential may continue to buoy the stock in the short term. However, achieving the level of growth required to justify the current valuation will be extremely challenging for SoundHound. The company's reliance on acquisitions suggests that organic scalability remains elusive, and its size makes future acquisitions less impactful.

SoundHound has made strides in developing its technology, particularly through Polaris, a multimodal foundation model trained on billions of conversations and millions of hours of audio. This model promises greater accuracy and lower hosting costs, which SoundHound has been gradually rolling out across its customer base. Polaris currently powers a third of SoundHound's AI interactions with restaurant customers, with plans to expand this coverage further. Additional advancements, such as reducing hallucinations and improving performance in noisy environments like vehicles, are also being pursued. However, given the company’s two-decade history, it is unclear if technological limitations have been the primary factor hindering its growth.

The automotive segment, one of SoundHound’s primary markets, has shown limited success despite the company’s long-standing presence. LLMs have enabled significant improvements in voice AI, but questions remain about whether voice interfaces will achieve widespread adoption or remain a niche feature. Vehicles represent one scenario where voice AI offers clear advantages, but even this market faces challenges. The anticipated rollout of advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving features may reduce the need for voice AI in vehicles, limiting its potential market.

While SoundHound has reported some traction in the automotive industry, including deals with four EV OEMs and growth in markets like the Middle East, China, and India, its overall impact remains modest. Automotive revenue is estimated to be below $40 million annually, and the company continues to rely heavily on its relationship with Stellantis. Recent milestones, such as the integration of Chat AI into vehicles from brands like Alfa Romeo and Citroen, have yielded encouraging results, including increased usage and higher customer satisfaction scores. However, the scale of these achievements falls short of establishing SoundHound as a major player in the automotive sector.

The company’s pivot toward voice AI solutions for restaurants highlights its challenges in the automotive market. Acquisitions of Synq3 and Amelia have fueled growth in this segment, with SoundHound targeting a $1 billion revenue opportunity in drive-thru solutions. However, the reliance on acquisitions raises questions about the product’s market fit and competitive positioning. SoundHound has secured partnerships with a wide range of restaurant chains, including Panda Express, Church’s Texas Chicken, and White Castle. The company has also surpassed 100 million phone-ordering interactions, recently adding Torchy’s Tacos and a top-ten global pizza brand to its portfolio. While voice AI offers value in scenarios like drive-thru ordering, the broader adoption of touchscreens and mobile apps may limit its growth potential. Moreover, the restaurant AI market remains fragmented, with competitors like IBM, Google, and Microsoft pursuing similar opportunities.

Despite SoundHound’s claims of superior accuracy, metrics in this space are not standardized, making it difficult to assess the company’s relative performance. Various competitors have reported impressive results, such as Wendy’s FreshAI achieving an 86% success rate for fully automated orders during pilot tests. Smaller players like Hi Auto and Valyant AI have also gained traction, highlighting the competitive and fragmented nature of the market.

Financially, SoundHound’s revenue rose 89% year-over-year in the third quarter to $25 million, but this growth was primarily driven by acquisitions. Organic growth appears to have declined by roughly 50%, as prior-year figures included one-off revenue from a major automotive customer. The company has forecasted revenue of $82–85 million for 2024 and $155–175 million for 2025, suggesting minimal growth for its core business in the near future.

Profit margins have also been a challenge. Gross margins fell to 49% in the third quarter due to acquisition costs, though non-GAAP gross margins were reported at 60%. Longer-term, the company aims for gross margins of 70% or higher and EBITDA margins above 30%. However, these targets remain far from reach. SoundHound expects to achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability in 2025, though this metric excludes significant expenses such as stock-based compensation and depreciation.

SoundHound ended the third quarter with $136 million in cash and equivalents, along with $39 million in debt carrying a 15% annual cost. Management has hinted at the possibility of raising equity to reduce debt, but this would have a limited impact given the company’s current market capitalization.

Looking ahead, SoundHound’s revenue is projected to reach $275–325 million by 2029. At its current valuation, this implies a 30x forward revenue multiple—significantly higher than historical norms, even during speculative market conditions. By comparison, valuations during the peak of the SaaS boom typically ranged around 15x forward revenue. As a result, SoundHound’s stock price is likely to decline significantly unless the company can deliver extraordinary performance in the coming years.

SoundHound operates in a competitive, fragmented market and lacks clear competitive advantages. While its technology has shown promise, the broader market dynamics and the company’s poor financial fundamentals make its current valuation difficult to justify. Based on these factors, SoundHound’s stock is likely overvalued and could settle closer to $5 per share as market sentiment realigns with reality.

**TL;DR:** SoundHound has seen a surge in its stock price, driven by acquisitions and AI hype, but its fundamentals are weak, and organic growth is negative. With increasing competition in fragmented markets and a reliance on inorganic growth, the company’s current valuation appears unsustainable. A significant stock price correction seems likely.

Recently I read through reddit discussions on AI and I noticed many people think AI will take *all* jobs and humans will not be needed any longer. It sounds like disaster is coming and we are witnessing the collapse of civilisation as we know it. I doubt that this is the case. Let me explain why and how it impacts the investing world.

**AI will not replace humans**

Can you imagine the situation when your boss is asking you on why some decision was made and you're telling him ""Because AI told me to do so"". This is pure nonsense. For every decision made there must a responsible human worker or at least someone who can elaborate why this or that happened and what was the reasoning behind it.  
Of course some low paying jobs will be reduced to bare minimum (call center operators and cashier), but human-to-human services, engineers, gas and oil workers, doctors and most of professionals of any kind will keep their jobs for years to come.

**Productivity boost**

I am using AI for my software engineering job on daily basis. It's my new buddy who is verifying the work I am doing, suggesting improvements, reviewing PRs, writing tests for me. I think the usage of Cursor has increased my productivity at least 2x. This leads to an improvements in code quality and reduces the cost of maintenance, etc. I see the increase in productivity is happening all over the industry. I know that such things are happening to all across creative industries. People are pleased to use AI for generating, validating, learning. You would definitely say, that the productivity boost is not for every industry and you are right.

**Cost optimisation**

Across nearly every sector, AI acts like a silent CFO - constantly looking for ways to reduce waste and improve margins. And higher margins usually translate to higher earnings per share over time.  
It will affect most companies in almost all industries:  
\- Factories can use AI to monitor machines and energy use, cutting electricity bills and reducing waste.  
\- Software companies can let AI manage their cloud resources, automatically scaling servers up or down and saving thousands on infrastructure.  
\- Retailers use AI to predict demand more accurately - fewer products sitting in warehouses, fewer discounts just to clear inventory.  
\- Logistics and transport companies optimise delivery routes and fuel use.  
\- Customer support teams let AI handle routine questions, freeing humans for the complex ones.  
\- Finance departments automate invoices and expense checks.  
\- Healthcare systems use AI for scheduling, diagnostics, and preventing unnecessary tests.  
Even marketing teams now rely on AI to target ads better and spend less for the same results.

**Impact on the stock market and companies finances**

Knowing everything above I assume we might come to some conclusions:  
\- Best AI models/Cloud computing providers will continue winning and growing their revenues.  
\- The spendings of companies might be reduced by optimising costs (electricity, computational bills).  
\- Productivity per capita of the workforce will rise (for creative industries by 30+%).  
\- All of these will lead to earnings growth, pushing stocks price even higher, dividends would be paid, new acquisitions will happen due to an increase of free cash flow.

Of course, the stock market is volatile and unpredictable, but if you think long term... The boost is inevitable.

**P.S.** You might think wtf, why I should listen to a random guy on reddit. Spot on, indeed. So, why I think my input on this might be considered:  
\- I obtained data science master degree.  
\- I have 10 years of software engineering experience and the current company I am working for is encouraging their staff to use AI.  
\- I tried to do different startups as a side hustles and I crave AI agents helping me building it.  
\- I also invest in AI companies heavily and those are about 30% of [my investing portfolio](https://app.mecompounding.com/reference/53616c7465645f5fe1cbf1fed6e463de514be08b6169ea57cac9a40aa289b902d5fd2eda2fbb54d4ed77121379eef3be).  
**P.P.S.** No, this post is not generated by AI. I wrote it manually.  
**P.P.P.S.** Try to ask Gemini: ""Provide me with the comprehensive stock analysis of \[your stock here\] including recent news, earnings and sentiments"". The quality of results might surpise you.

1kjjd0h,2025-05-10 22:19:59,Reddit,investing,GOOGL,"Is investing in stocks already heavily favored by ETFs smart? Furthermore, is 100% stock portfolios worth the risk?","I left a comment elsewhere which after posting it made me curious about making it a post. Forgive me if I spell something incorrectly, English is not my first language.

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4590406

So I read this paper about 100% Stock portfolios after watching a YouTube video on it (multiple out there).

And I wondered how I’d go about choosing the stocks I’d invest in. I did so because just last year I didn’t touch stocks but when I went on my app on my iPhone (Stocks) and saw how much I could have made had I just invested in stocks that were already a big presence in almost all of my ETFs the. I’d have more value to my name.

To look at it I viewed an era that had large fluctuations in which I invested in which lead me to 2019 to 2024 because in-between that we had the fed-induced boom and the crash that came before that along with other crazy fluctuations.

So for my example I used march 2019 to March 2024 (which had steep decreases and increases):

1.MSFT: 250.92% 
2.Apple: 248%
3.Meta: 176.44%
4.Googl: 149%
5.Amazon: 96.46%

1.QQQ: 140.45%
2.VTI: 84.34%
3.VOO: 81.39%
4.VT: 54.38%

Here is the Summary of percentages those sticks hold for each ETF:

1. QQQ: ~41.3%
2. VOO: ~22.2%
3. VTI: ~13.0%
4. VT: ~6.1%


It’s not like investing in Meta, Apple, Google, and Amazon is unheard of, they already make a huge part of all ETFs you come across that measure commonly used domestic indexes. So… is this the way? I truly want your critique on this because if it works it works and if not then it doesn’t, it’s not about proving I’m right it’s about maximizing my understanding of investing. 



Edit: I think people misunderstood and I didn’t articulate it well either. IM NOT PREACHING FOR 100% stocks but I want your opinions on it! I want to see if maybe it IS the way. I want to grow my knowledge on the topic.

For transparency I’m (23 M) currently at 51k

1mz5fhj,2025-08-24 21:46:03,Reddit,StockMarket,GOOGL,How Reddit was able to significantly beat Q2 estimates & why I think they will beat in Q3,"Reddit grew revenue YoY by 78% & guided Q3 revenue up to $545m which I think they will also easily beat. 

Q2 came as a surprise to many, largely in part to the CEO staying early Q2 traffic looked weak on the Q1 earnings call. April traffic did end up coming in weak, but sharply rose through May into June. This led to a much greater number of ad impressions than expected & in turn a nice revenue beat. EPS also continued to rise, marking their 4th straight positive EPS quarter (which qualifies them for potential S&P inclusion). 

**Why Q3 is looking like it will shape up to be another beat:** 
Organic traffic QTD is up big as of yesterday - worldwide traffic crossed 2B for the first time ever. US traffic crossed 1B for the first time ever as well. These are significant highs on this front, worldwide traffic (per SEMRUSH was in the 1B range this time last year, indicating a 100% increase in traffic YoY in Q3 to date)

I believe the recent traffic surge is due to Cloudflare auto opting sites in to blocking crawlers from accessing sites. How does this help Reddit? Reddit has a data deal with ChatGPT for their data (same with Google) which has now led to them referring reddit at a much higher rate (up 87%) since the crawler block started (7/1) and the site traffic backs it up. Recent studies have shown ChatGPT referrals to Reddit have climbed massively during Q3. ChatGPT is going to prioritize companies who they already pay which is why Reddit is a strong beneficiary of this move. 

During June Reddit also upgraded their ad tool suite to integrate LLMs and it’s a recipe for huge earnings upside. It’s not a coincidence that the number of advertisers on this site has exploded in the last quarter. They love the new insights Reddits ad tools are bringing & are also taking note on how much traffic Google & ChatGPT are driving to the site.

Lastly, the new UI is embedding search into the homepage which should make the site / app more sticky. Putting the sites data to better use has been their MO this year and it’s been paying huge dividends.

**TLDR**
If organic traffic data continues to hold up through September I believe we are looking at strong potential for a massive beat. Users & advertisers have been flocking to Reddit at levels never seen before during Q3.",240

Today started with selling pressure and hit the 5,488.73. If the index does not recover, we may be looking at more negative month.

The public sentiment about who’s leading the AI race changes every other week, but Google’s Gemini is almost never last in any list. This, combined with Google’s already pretty big stronghold on the search and browser business means they have a significant advantage over the competition when it comes to AI **and** browsers. (it’s pretty well known that Google has implemented AI into chrome for a good while now)

Search(ads) and browsers are Google’s moats. Google knows this, and they haven’t stopped innovating. 

Looking ahead, the hard catalyst is the antitrust ruling for Chrome in August. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s browser is supposedly weeks away, and Perplexity’s ‘Comet’ is already in Public Beta. ",200

Job market was weak in July. On the other hand, consumer confidence jumped 95.2 to 97.2 in July. It is still weak, but it is higher the lowest level in March. The U.S. and China have agreed to extend tariff truce, but it wasn't enough to lift. The stock market closed lower. 🔴

During the session, FOMC meeting completed and interest rates unchanged as expected. Powell said we have made no decisions about September meeting. However, CME FedWatch tool is showing 80% possibility of 25 point rate cut in September. The stock market closed lower again. 🔴

Whereas Google’s market capitalization is below $2 trillion, Luria said in a note to investors Monday that the lump sum of Google’s businesses, when valued separately, would be $3.7 trillion.

Luria said Google should break up YouTube, Search, Google Cloud, Waymo, and its AI segments.
That’s because Alphabet stock is trading at a historically low multiple of 16 times its forward earnings (over the next 12 months) — "" well below market multiple,"" he said.

1koopur,2025-05-17 11:09:48,Reddit,StockMarket,GOOGL,Analysis on US Credit score downgrade by Moody's on 16.5.,"Analysis by Gemini Deep Research:

Moody's just downgraded the US credit rating to Aa1 from Aaa! This is the last major agency to do so, following S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023.
Why? Moody's is pointing to rising government debt, increasing interest costs, and political gridlock preventing fiscal fixes. They expect the federal deficit to hit ~9% of GDP by 2035!

Seen this before?
 * S&P 2011 Downgrade: Market dipped (-1.7% in the following week), Treasury yields FELL as investors sought safety, Gold went UP. 

 * Fitch 2023 Downgrade: Milder reaction. Stocks down slightly (-1.3% in the following week), Treasury yields nudged UP, Gold reaction was muted.

What to expect now?
 * Equities: Potential short-term jitters, but long-term impact might be limited (like previous downgrades). Watch out for interest-sensitive sectors.

 * Bonds: Likely see Treasury yields creep up, corporate bond spreads could widen. 

 * Commodities: Gold might get a boost as a safe haven. Oil could be volatile depending on the economic outlook.

Good news? Moody's revised the outlook to stable, citing the US economy's strengths and the dollar's reserve status.

TLDR: Moody's downgraded the US credit rating (last one to do it). Similar downgrades in the past saw short-term market wobbles but no long-term meltdown. Keep an eye on bonds and gold.

🔹 $MSFT CFO – “In FY ’26, we expect to continue investing against strong demand signals.”

🔹 $GOOGL CFO – “We expect to invest ~$75B in CapEx in 2025… Given the increase in CapEx investments over the past few years, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate in 2025.”

The Reality:

No one cares about DeepSeek or any other so-called “competitor” that makes headlines with inflated hype. Whether it cost them $100M or $6M is irrelevant when the market demands more than what current infrastructure can supply.

As Andy Jassy (Amazon CEO) put it: “It is true that AWS could be growing faster if not for some of the capacity constraints today.”

1naptfg,2025-09-07 12:30:33,Reddit,StockMarket,"NVDA, GOOGL",Are we in an AI bubble? Theory of micro-bursts,"Everyone and their dog is calling AI a bubble. When your Uber driver starts comparing NVDA to Cisco circa 1999, you know the ""bubble"" narrative has gone mainstream. But here's the thing - a bubble that everyone sees coming isn't really a bubble.

## We're still in the picks-and-shovels phase

Look at where the money's actually flowing - it's not into revolutionary AI products, it's into GPUs, data centers, and power infrastructure. We're basically in 1997 building out the internet's backbone. The real question isn't whether AI is overhyped (it is), but whether the infrastructure play has legs. History suggests it does.

But the next 2-3 years will be make-or-break for the monetization story. Either AI starts generating real revenue streams beyond ""we added a chatbot to our app"" or we're in for a reckoning.

## The bullshit-to-reality ratio is off the charts

Every non-technical analyst is suddenly an AI expert, and every AI CEO is promising AGI by next Tuesday. Remember when Anthropic's CEO said 90% of code would be AI-written within 6 months? That was 6 months ago. Meanwhile, AI customer service is still a dumpster fire, and most ""AI features"" are solutions looking for problems.

But here's what's actually happening under the noise: AI is quietly eating away at the edges of white-collar work. Not the dramatic ""AI replaces all programmers"" narrative, but more like ""tasks that took an hour of googling now take 5 minutes with ChatGPT."" It works maybe 9 times out of 10, which is good enough to justify layoffs in content mills, basic data entry, and first-level support roles.

## The micro-burst thesis

Forget the single massive bubble pop. The AI trade will be death by a thousand cuts - or wealth by a thousand rallies. Every earnings season becomes a referendum on AI adoption. Company misses AI targets? -15% in a day. Competitor shows actual AI revenue? +20% the next week.

This volatility is a feature, not a bug. The market's trying to price something that nobody really understands yet, in small and cautious steps.

## Macro resilience through dependency

The beauty of the US AI infrastructure play is that the entire world is becoming dependent on it. Even if the US gets hit with recession, trade wars, or whatever chaos comes next, the rest of the world still needs American AI compute. It's the new oil, except America is the only one with refineries.

Sure, ETF flows might create short-term correlation with broader market dumps, but AI infrastructure will likely lead any recovery. Where else is global capital going to go? European AI? Chinese models trained on censored data?

## The uncomfortable truth

This is America's game to lose. The combination of AI dominance and political tailwinds (regardless of your politics, deregulation = higher margins) creates a perfect storm for equity holders. The wealth gap will get uglier, but that's a policy problem, not a portfolio problem.

So, position accordingly. The AI revolution won't be televised - it'll be priced in quarterly increments.

1hacni0,2024-12-09 16:46:43,Reddit,StockMarket,"TSLA, GOOGL",QUBT is about to crash hard,"Context: Quantum computing is having its moment. It’s risky, but could massively disrupt industries in areas like computing, finance and cyber security. But stock market bubbles are forming. 

Quantum computing is probably the most technically difficult industry for analysts to assess. Few people are equipped with an adequate understanding of quantum technologies, which is leading to massive mispricing. 

QUBT is junk

Quantum Computing Inc. has many problems. Iceberg Research’s recent short report covers some of them. They note that the firm has run from one fad to another (chips, ai, computing) and failed at each. They list several misleading claims that QUBT has made and withdrawn. The report is damning and raises serious questions about the future of the company, I encourage you all to read it. 

However Iceberg does not go far enough.

https://iceberg-research.com/2024/11/27/quantum-computing-inc-the-phantom-chip-foundry/

QUBT lacks talent. Successful quantum innovations requires strong technical knowledge that you really can only come by in either leading universities or megacap firms like google. 

I went through the Linkedin profiles of each of QUBT’s employees and compared them with their small cap competitors. I tallied up the share of employees that went to an Edu Rank top-100 world universities for Quantum Physics (which is a very broad net), QUBT ranks incredibly poorly among it’s peers - less than a fifth of employees (see picture)*. This is robust to different ranking metrics. Counting only Ivy leagues QUBT comes out much worse.

But look, not all employees are on linkedin. Maybe QUBT is the next big underdog? No. 

A large share of QUBT’s “talent” comes from the Steven’s Institute of Technology, an unremarkable university in New Jersey (ranked 150+ for Quantum Physics depending on list) 

The company’s Chief Quantum Officer is Yuping Huang. On first glance he appears to have a prolific publishing history; however, most papers receive low citations and/or he is third, fourth or fifth author. Huang was previously sued by shareholders for breaching fiduciary duties when he merged his previous company QPhoton with QUBT. Notably he is both a QUBT director and employee, which is a big corporate governance redflag (reminds me of $SAVA). 

There is only one independent director with a background in Quantum Physics to provide checks and balance on Huang — Dr Javad Shabani. He is not up to the task. His publishing history is mediocre. 

Looking deeper, the Chief Technology Officer Yong Meng Sua, has an even more mediocre publishing history. And has only risen to an Assistant Professor role at Steven’s. He spends much of his time discussing esoteric computing questions tangential to his work (i.e. the NP=P problem, see their LinkedIn posts)

And finally the Director of the Company’s chip foundry (Iceberg has raised significant questions about the foundry). Dr Milan Begliarbekov after finishing high school enrolled in a bachelor’s degree in English literature at Steven’s, graduated, then immediately enrolled in a physics Phd at Steven’s. Either he is a savant polymath who is able to pick up grad school physics level math, or a Phd from Steven’s is worthless. His publishing career is very mediocre. 

These scientists will not crack the major problems stopping widespread commercialization of Quantum tech. Simply compare their publishing records to the founder at Ion-Q (Peter Chapman) or leading quantum scientists at Google, alongside the significant and verifiable technological advancements these companies have made. 

Another clue that something is amiss is headcount. Rigetti has three fold the number of employees as QUBT. QBTS has six fold. All have similar market cap. What’s driving value? We’ve established that it’s not human capital. Iceberg’s research reveals it’s not intellectual property or physical capital either. 

So why has it done so well? QUBT’s high valuation is driven by regarded retail investors.

Only 3.3% of QUBT is held by institutional investors (and falling). Compared with ~40% for IONQ, ~30% for RGTI and ~47% for QBTS. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qubt/institutional-holdings

The lack of institutional investment in QUBT while institutional investors are simultaneously clamouring to load up on quantum stocks is a massive red flag that something is up with QUBT. In fact no Wall Street analysts track QUBT. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/quantum-computing-qubt-stock-skyrockets-short-sellers-are-lurking

So what happens next? 

QUBT’s 800% rise in one month is going to attract short selling interest as people realise it’s junk. The stock will fall back below $1. 

Risk:
If you want to short/buy puts, You can rest assured that the company is not going to suddenly become profitable. The main risk comes from why QUBT has done so well, despite having little revenue, expertise, or innovation to show for it.

QUBT is literally called Quantum Computing Incorporated. If you’re a full regard wanting to invest in Quantum computing are you going to invest in IonQ (what?), Rigetti (spaghetti company?) or a company conveniently called Quantum Computing? It’s a regard trap. 

It’s like being interested in electric cars and passing on Tesla because you wanted to invest in a stock called Electric Car Co. 

My positions

1000 put contracts to sell @$4.50, cost average = 0.11, expiring Dec 20. If this doesn’t work I’m going to buy puts again and again. This company sucks. 

I’m long IonQ and after doing this DD I will probably also buy Rigetti in the near future.

Totally get the excitement, but I’m personally sitting this one out. Here’s why:

**The data’s not great**

There’s this stat I always come back to: From 1980 to 2023, the average Day 1 return for tech IPOs was +54% (yep, that’s nice). But the 3-year average return? -13%.And when you adjust for market performance, it’s closer to -20%. It gets even worse if VCs didn’t participate — those IPOs tend to be straight-up value traps. Like, -22% to -26% annualized.

So yeah, Day 1 might be fun… but sticking around usually isn’t.

Even the big names got wrecked early on

* Facebook IPO’d at $30, dropped to $17 before it ever recovered
* Google did okay at IPO, but didn’t really take off for 16 months
* Netflix went from $1 to $0.30 before becoming a beast

Recent “hot” IPOs - Same vibes

* Robinhood: $34 IPO → $7
* Coinbase: $330 IPO → $30
* Palantir: $10 to $40 to… $5 💀
* Opendoor: $10 to $0.2, LOL

**Why it keeps happening**

It’s always the same pattern:

* Big hype before launch
* Investment banks picks the besting timing for IPO
* FOMO kicks in
* Retail piles in
* Then reality hits… and insiders start unloading

Basically, IPO day is a liquidity event for insiders, not an opportunity for you and me. By the time retail gets in, the music’s already slowing down.

**What I’m doing instead**

Waiting. Let the hype die down. Wait for the lock-up to expire. Let the market reprice it based on real performance, not vibes. If the company’s legit (and some of them are!), that’s when you can enter with conviction — and actually hold long-term. That's how I make money in this market.

From my own beliefs, the biggest driving force behind this company is actually Dr. Bertrand Reulet imo, not the CEO and not anyone else. Here's why.

[Dr Bertrand Reulet himself.](https://preview.redd.it/g5tvdnwghbce1.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=f722aaad32e4069f35dc18d17f1ef6363196d69f)

Dr. Bertrand Reulet’s contributions to Quantum eMotion Inc. have been integral in positioning the company as a leader in the emerging quantum cybersecurity sector. His expertise in quantum mechanics and signal processing directly led to the development of Quantum eMotion’s **Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)** technology, a device that uses quantum principles to generate true random numbers crucial for secure encryption.

[Design of Quantum eMotion QRNG Technology](https://preview.redd.it/36u98h2ihbce1.png?width=702&format=png&auto=webp&s=67f98587ce254d9fa1e8f3cf222680b8366d734d)

[QNG2 - QRNG implemented on a computer chip](https://preview.redd.it/x57zjm3jhbce1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c90fdea190a1fb61dce382bf1722f4210acf40f)

Reulet is also appointed as the **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)** and he has been central to the development and commercialization of this technology, which addresses a significant security gap in the face of quantum computing advancements. His research focused on **non-Gaussian noise** and its application to the creation of high-quality quantum randomness, a cornerstone of Quantum eMotion’s encryption solutions. This is what actually led to the creation of the **QRNG2**, capable of producing entropy at speeds of **1.5 Gb/s**, making it one of the fastest quantum entropy sources available (with scalability).

[The man himself appointed as CSO & Chairman of SAB](https://preview.redd.it/rc8k5dlkhbce1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=edc7be656f2de17c2478fcd4ff67e6a58732fbc3)

Dr. Reulet's leadership has also been vital in ensuring the technology meets stringent industry standards, including compliance with the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**, making it one of the most secure solutions for encryption on the market. His role extended beyond product development, influencing Quantum eMotion’s strategic direction and long-term vision to incorporate quantum-safe security protocols for industries such as **blockchain**, **healthcare**, and **cloud computing**.

[Dr. Bertrand Reulet achievements. \(Look at the number of citations!\)](https://preview.redd.it/7gpaujjlhbce1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=379f7f84861b6d7efca6b4887184642db2ce44dc)

In addition to his role at QeM, Dr. Reulet serves as a **professor at the University of Sherbrooke** and holds the **Canada Excellence Research Chair in Quantum Signal Processing**, emphasizing his dual commitment to advancing both academic and applied quantum research. His leadership in **transdisciplinary research** and collaboration with institutions like **CNRS in France** is actually what further strengthens his influence on Quantum eMotion’s innovations.

So, what's the next main point of this post? Well, I just mainly want to talk about this research paper of his that I believe is the most instrumental foundation of QeM QRNG technology and why it stands out.

Enter Dr. Bertrand Reulet Paper on:

**Electron-Photon Correlations and the Third Moment of Quantum Noise.**

Dr. Bertrand Reulet’s paper on ""Electron-photon correlations and the third moment of quantum noise"" dives into the quantum noise properties and correlations and imo, this forms the backbone of Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs). While the paper doesn’t outright say electrons are better than photons for QRNGs, it does highlight why electron-based systems might offer some key advantages over photon-based systems in the context of randomness generation.

Here goes. I'm not an expert at compiling things I read online but I have years of experience reading research papers (though not in this field and hence, I picked out some key information that a **typical retail investor** would find interesting and useful, just like me.)

1. Quantum Noise and True Randomness QRNGs rely on quantum noise (the inherent uncertainty in quantum systems) to generate true random numbers. Reulet’s paper explores the statistical properties of quantum noise and higher-order moments, like the **third moment**. These moments are crucial because they determine the quality of the randomness—whether the numbers generated are truly unpredictable and unbiased. This is vital for cryptographic applications where security depends on the unpredictability of the random numbers used.

[Electronic noise in a system. It's alright, I don't understand this too but that's not the point.](https://preview.redd.it/9j0ii8enhbce1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a701528aee1f7cf534432eb59367a9528cad7da)



[This is the point.](https://preview.redd.it/ak38ybpohbce1.png?width=851&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2a36f61ede81229046a9f3e88c2b78a16601381)

In this passage, Reulet and his team measured the impedance (Z) of a sample over a frequency range of 300 kHz to 8 GHz. They actually found out that the system behaves like a resistor (50.4 Ω) in parallel with a capacitor (0.6 pF), leading to a frequency cutoff of about 6 GHz. The external impedance (Zext) is assumed to be 50 Ω, and the effective impedance (Reff) is calculated to be 22.8 Ω.

# So now, why is this important for Electron-Based Systems & QRNG?

* Electron-Based Systems: This is related to electron-based systems (like quantum random number generators, QRNGs), which often use components like tunnel junctions (QeM here uses electron tunneling). By understanding and controlling impedance, these systems can be optimized for better performance.
* Impedance Matching: In QRNGs and other solid-state systems, impedance matching ensures that the system works efficiently, improving things like signal transmission and noise management. It’s actually easier to fine-tune electron-based systems, leading to more reliable performance compared to photon-based systems.
* So, what's the catch then? For QRNGs, managing impedance well helps reduce noise, making the random numbers generated more reliable and secure. Plus, electron-based systems are **more scalable** and simpler to integrate into existing technologies than photon-based systems, which need complex optical components.

Overall, I just wanted to say that this research explains how measuring and adjusting impedance helps optimize electron-based systems like QRNGs. Don't worry, its difficult even for me to fully understand but the key point here is that **proper impedance** matching leads to better performance, more reliable random numbers, and simpler integration, making electron-based QRNGs a good choice for **solid-state systems.**

Now, moving on next...

2. Electron-Photon Correlations  
In the paper, Reulet looks at the correlations between electrons and photons. These correlations influence how randomness can be extracted, and while photons are often the go-to for optical QRNGs, electrons can actually be the better choice, especially in **solid-state systems** (Keep this in mind as this is important).

Electrons do have certain advantages over photons because:

* Electrons are easier to measure and manipulate in condensed matter systems (like quantum dots or superconducting circuits).
* Their interactions with electric fields are more easily controlled than photons, which can be more difficult to measure in certain setups.

1. Why Electrons Might Be Better for QRNGs compared to Photons-based QRNG (Big firms involved in these are ID Quantique, Quantum Dice, QuintessenceLabs, Toshiba Corp)

[Example of ID Quantique Photon-based QRNG](https://preview.redd.it/euwu0fhqhbce1.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=e62e2e78cf20999ff444ff02c58375ad3788c26c)

While photon-based QRNGs are popular in optical systems, I beg to differ about what electron-based QRNGs are able to offer:

* Better control and stability: Electrons can be controlled more precisely, making their randomness generation more reliable and stable. (Lesser noise)
* Faster performance: Electron-based systems could be faster because they don’t rely on complex optical setups. (Important because this allows for faster set-up)
* Compact and cost-effective: Solid-state systems that use electrons can be **smaller**, cheaper, and more scalable than photon-based systems. (Huge for scalability and in our fast-moving era, this is especially critical since electron-based system are really cheap as well)

1. The way i see things practically. Dr. Reulet’s work essentially sets the foundation for QRNGs that can use either electrons or photons, depending on the design of the system. For solid-state systems (like quantum dots or superconducting circuits), electrons are potentially the **better choice** for randomness generation because of scale.

Did you catch that? Yep. **""Superconducting circuits""** These circuits often involve the use of Josephson junctions, which are key components in superconducting qubits (the basic units of quantum computers). The most well-known quantum computing companies, like **IBM**, **Google**, and **Rigetti Computing**, use superconducting circuits to build their quantum computers and who is currently testing our product? **IBM**.

[Best example I can find. As you can see, the top choices supported by giant firms are superconducting circuits.](https://preview.redd.it/2u2rw80shbce1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4ad60e0082d35e8cdac226d134b6706400c62b4)

TLDR: Electron-based QRNGS allow for more compact setups, lower cost, and better integration with existing technologies, making them ideal for scalable, real-world QRNG applications. This is disruptive technology in the making, and I believe 2025 is going to be the fastest year of progress for them. Ignore the FUDs and everything else, if you want out, stay out. If you are in and long, the daily noises don't matter just like how Reulet best work involves the removal of noises. Get it? (That's a joke.) Cheers to all.I had some time today and would like to push out some more information for newcomers in this field. From my own beliefs, the biggest driving force behind this company is actually Dr. Bertrand Reulet imo, not the CEO and not anyone else. Here's why.",6

It’s been going well, but I keep wondering if there’s a smarter way to streamline the process, especially when it comes to automation.

Not looking to go full algo, but more interested in using no-code or low-code tools like Zapi⁤er, Noti⁤on, or Airtable to automate alerts, journaling, or even basic order execution through APIs. I found google sheets also isn't the worst: [**https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093281?hl=en-GB**](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093281?hl=en-GB), however I want something more intuitive

Came across a couple of interesting suggestions from other Reddit threads like [**Capit⁤**](http://capitalize.ai/)[**alize.ai**](http://alize.ai) and [**Nvestiq**](https://www.nvestiq.com/).

Curious if anyone here has used no-code tools for trading workflows, and what’s worked well for you. Open to ideas.",4

My question is about if I own shares in an ETF that tracks... let's say tech companies. Is it going to be better if I invest in an ETF that tracks all or most of the magnificent 7 as well as other companies of course or is it going to be better to invest in... let's say Google (Alphabet). Now let's say that Google   wins the AI super race and develops some breakthrough that makes their individual stock surge with the other companies still performing relatively well while they catch up. Will I still reap the same benefit having been invested in the ETF or would I have been better investing in the company itself.

TLDR -Should I invest in each of the tech companies I believe will have an AI breakthrough first? Or bundle them all into an ETF?",3

I immediately thought it would like crowdstrike did a few months ago?

A lot of people have realized just how much control AWS has over the internet, and this is why I’m basically all in.

AWS owns a huge part of the infrastructure powering the internet. Consider these stats: 80% of the world’s population owns a smartphone, and Google and Apple account for 99.7% of all smartphones globally. About 95% of these phones come pre-installed with apps from Meta, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Chrome, and others. On enterprise computers, 92% run Microsoft services. Hardware-wise, 72% of computers use Intel processors, and 32% have AMD hardware.

The key takeaway? Google alone holds data on 77% of the world’s population—covering everything from browsing history and biometrics to banking, communication, private chats, photos, and location data.

With the recent market crash, companies will spend more on failover and disaster recovery resources spread across geographic regions—often hosted on AWS.

Imagine this simple setup for your website: one web server and one database server. AWS lets you choose the geographic region to host these servers, often close to your customers. You can also use multi-region setups where servers run or stand by in multiple locations.

Here’s why multi-region AWS deployment matters:

* Disaster recovery and resilience: If one region goes down, another can immediately take over.
* High availability: Active-active or active-passive setups reduce downtime with near-zero recovery time.
* Performance and reduced latency: Resources placed closer to users improve their experience.
* Data sovereignty: Companies can keep data in specific geographic locations to comply with local laws.

How it works technically: AWS regions are physically separate, so failures in one won’t affect others. Data replication services like Amazon MemoryDB Multi-Region sync data asynchronously across regions, and routing tools like Amazon Route 53 direct users to the closest or healthiest region.

Common architecture patterns include:

* Active-passive: One region handles traffic, and another is on standby.
* Active-active: Multiple regions handle traffic simultaneously for better performance but higher complexity.

Important to keep in mind: multi-region deployments are more complex and expensive. Data consistency across regions is a challenge, especially in active-active setups. Regular testing of failover processes is essential.

AWS’s massive market share—about 30% globally in cloud infrastructure as of mid-2025—supports its dominance and enables all of this. Their scale, reliability, and innovation in infrastructure keep them at the center of the internet’s backbone.

This dominance, paired with the vast reach of Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta, demonstrates how concentrated yet critical the internet’s infrastructure and data are. AWS is not just part of the internet—it practically owns the cloud foundation that powers it all.
